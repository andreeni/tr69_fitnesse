<Start: SRS-162298-HeNBStrtUp-390, Requirement>
If download of the initial software image fails. e.g (File server not responding/overload etc) the HeNB shall retry indefinitely. The retry period shall be 10 minutes.
Note: If the recovery software is unable to download an initial software image the startup procedure cannot continue, hence it is reasonable to retry the download periodically. A factory reset or reboot will initiate the startup procedure again.
