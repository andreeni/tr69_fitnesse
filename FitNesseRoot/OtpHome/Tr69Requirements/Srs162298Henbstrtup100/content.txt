<Start: SRS-162298-HeNBStrtUp-100, Requirement>
At the factory the HeNB shall be provisioned with information before it is deployed. This shall  include the following information:
•	EUI – as specified in 3GPP TS23.003
•	OUI + serial number
•	Operator Domain name – This will be used for two purposes:
1. to resolve IP addresses during initial contact (before the HeNB has a MIB database). 
2. as an expected identity to match the SeGW's certificate against.
•	Own certificate chain
•	Default SeGW FQDN 
•	Trust Anchor CA certificates - used to authenticate the Default SeGW, Initial & Assigned HDMs
•	Initial Generic SW – If a software image is not provisioned the HeNB shall execute its recovery software on startup.
•	Recovery SW
Note: Details on the format of the EUI, OUI & Serial Number can be found in the FRS for the 9762 Enterprise Cell 2x250mw Generic (feature #162839). Details on the use of the certificate chain & CA certificates can be found in SRS-eNB-MCI-NTK-SEC.
