<Start: SRS-162298-HeNBStrtUp-860, Requirement>
The registration timer for HeNB registration with HDM shall backoff in order to spread the load on the HDM in the case a large number of HeNBs are registering at the same time. The HeNB shall take the following approach when setting the registration timer,  
- for the first N attempts after reset the timer shall be set to X minutes, 
- then for each subsequent attempt the timer shall be increased by Y minutes until it reaches 1 hour,
- for all the following attempts after the above tries the timer shall be set to 1 hour. 

X is set to 7.5 minutes if the timer is started by the update in ManagementServer.URL or 2.5 minutes otherwise. Y is set to 5 minutes and N is 1. 
 
Note: The initial value is set  to 7.5 minutes to allow at least one PERIODIC inform after the BOOTSTRAP to the assigned HDM (assuming 5 minutes interval).
