<Start: SRS-HeNB-OAM-InventoryMgmt-200, Requirement>
The HeNB shall retrieve the inventory information provisioned in the factory data or from software application and populated them in the TR-106 DeviceInfo parameters. The default values of these parameters or format convention are defined as following,  
•	By default, Manufacturer shall be set to “Alcatel-Lucent”, and Manufacturer OUI shall be set to “001D4C”. They will be provisioned in the factory data.
•	The serial number shall be compliant with Alcatel-Lucent standard KS-24811.

Serial number format (18 chars):   LB ALLU LLL YY WW xxxxx
where LB - Issuing Agency Code, ALLU - Enterprise Identifier, LLL - Manufacturing Location Code, YY - Year,  WW - week,  xxxxx - running number

The 18 chars LB ALLU LLL YY WW xxxxx shall be stored in the flash memory of the product.
The 18 chars LB ALLU LLL YY WW xxxxx shall be printed on labels.
For compatibility reason with the existing network elements, it is allowed that only the 12 chars LLL YY WW xxxxx are sent to the network. In such a case, migration to a full 18-char serial number is for future release.

•	The Software Version and Additional Software Version shall be retrieved from the software application installed in the HeNB. 
The versioning format is “HeNB-<RR.RR.MM.mm>”, where
RR.RR= network release (00.00..99.99)
MM= major Version (00..99)
mm= minor Version (00..99)
[The above information need to be confirmed by the HeNB development]
•	The Product Calss and Model Name will be configured in the factory data during factory configuration. They are decided by the product and market teams. 
?	Product Class: pre-defined text, e.g.  “Alcatel-Lucent 9360 Small Cell Solution” 
?	Model Name: pre-defined text,  e.g. “9762 Enterprise Cell V1.0 2x250mW B25”
•	The Hardware Version will be configured in the factory data during factory configuration with the following format conventions.
<PU prefix>-<output power of the antenna>-<number of users>-<frequency bands>-<Remaining Fields>
?	The PU prefix field includes category code, version code and version number.  
?	The remaining fields could include GPS option, specific sniffing band, integrated backhaul option, or manufacturer index etc.

Here is an example of the HW version: EvL1.0-2x250mW-64-B25-4. 
The Additional Hardware Version will not be used for the HeNB per current agreement on inventory data. (Note: for HeNB, the format is “MaxPower - Frequency - MaxUser”.)
