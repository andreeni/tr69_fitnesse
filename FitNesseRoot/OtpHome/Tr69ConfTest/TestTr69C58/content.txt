FactoryReset 

!4 Purpose:
 
        The purpose of this test is to verify that the DUT is capable of performing factory reset procedure 
upon receipt of FactoryReset RPC from the ACS. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], if an ACS issues a FactoryReset RPC to the DUT, the 
DUT can choose to perform factory reset. The DUT must initiate the factory reset procedure only after 
successful completion of the session. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Schedule a FactoryReset RPC on the DUT with the CWMP analyzer. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to respond with FactoryResetResponse message. 
    4.  Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
    5.  Manually check the CPEâ€™s state. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The CPE does not attempt the Factory Reset before terminating the session. 
    2.  The CPE has returned to its Factory Reset state.
