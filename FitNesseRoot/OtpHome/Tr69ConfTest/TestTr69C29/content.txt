SetParameterValues SOAP Fault Format 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the SetParameterValuesFault element in a SOAP Fault 
response is formed properly. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS. 

!4 References:
 
        [1]     Any referenced documents or RFCs. 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to the Broadband Forum TR-069[1], along with the SOAP fault requirements outlined 
in the SOAP Fault Format test case, a SOAP Fault error during SetParameterValues must contain a 
SetParameterValuesFault element. This element is to be used only in an error response to the 
SetParameterValues method, that contains a list of one or more structures indicating the specific fault 
associated with each parameter in errror. The structure contains the following elements: 
     A ParameterName element that contains the full path name of the parameter in error. 
     A FaultCode element that contains a single numeric fault code that indicates the fault associated 
        with the particular parameter in error. 
     A FaultString element that contains a human readable description of the fault for the particular 
        parameter in error. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Instruct the CWMP analyzer to issue a SetParameterValues request on an invalid parameter. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to respond with a SOAP Fault. 
    4.  Analyze the SOAP Fault. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The SOAP faultcode element indicates the source of fault with either “Server” or “Client”.  
    2.  The SOAP faultstring sub-element contains the string “CWMP fault”. 
    3.  The SOAP message consists of a ParameterName element that contains the full path name of the 
        parameter in error. 
    4.   The SOAP message consists of a FaultCode element that contains a single numeric fault code 
         that indicates the fault associated with the particular parameter in error. 
    5.   The SOAP message consists of a FaultString element that contains a human readable description 
         of the fault for the particular parameter in error.
