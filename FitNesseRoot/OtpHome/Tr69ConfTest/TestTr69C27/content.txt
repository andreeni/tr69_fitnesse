SOAP Envelope Format 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the SOAP envelope encoded inside HTTP Messages sent by the 
DUT is properly formed. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS. 

!4 References:
 
        [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], SOAP 1.1 is the encoding syntax to transport the RPC 
method calls and responses in CPE WAN Management Protocol.        In doing so, the encoding must use the 
standard SOAP 1.1 envelope namespace identifier: “http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope”, and  
the standard SOAP 1.1 serialization namespace identifier: “http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding”.  
        All elements and attributes are associated with the namespace identifier “urn:dslforum- 
org:cwmp-1-1”. The namespace identifier for CPE WAN Management Protocol version 1.n is always  
“urn:dslforum-org:cwmp:1-n”, e.g. for v1.0 it was “urn:dslforum-org:cwmp:1-0” and for v1.42 it will be  
“urn:dslforum-org:cwmp:1-42”.  
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Instruct the CWMP analyzer to issue an arbitrary RPC supported by the DUT. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to respond with a successful response. 
    4.  Analyze the SOAP response from the CPE. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The SOAP message uses SOAP 1.1 envelope namespace identifier: 
        “http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope” 
    2.  The SOAP message uses SOAP 1.1 serialization namespace identifier: 
        “http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding” 
    3.  The SOAP message uses a namespace identifier compliant with the CWMP Protocol version.
