HTTP Redirection -Use of session cookies 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE can successfully communicate using cookies even 
after HTTP redirection. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

         [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], a CPE must include all cookies associated with the 
session in subsequent HTTP requests to the redirected ACS. The CPE must consider a redirect from an 
ACS to be a “verifiable transaction” and thus it must send cookies to the redirected ACS without  
performing domain validation of each cookie. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.   If the CWMP analyzer is capable of supporting multiple ACS URLs, configure an alternate ACS 
         URL on the CWMP analyzer. 
    3.  Configure the CWMP analyzer to use session cookies. 
    4.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Set the HTTP cookie in the HTTP response. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to send an empty HTTP POST or an Inform RPC to the CWMP analyzer. 
    4.  Analyze the HTTP message from the DUT to check if it is using the cookie sent by the ACS in its 
         POST. 
    5.   Issue an HTTP response with a 307 (Temporary Redirect) Status Code and the location of the new 
         HTTPS URL. 
    6.  Allow the DUT to issue the same HTTP POST message to the new URL. 
    7.  Analyze the HTTP message from the DUT to check if it is using the cookie sent by the previous 
        ACS in its POST. 
    8.  Allow the DUT to close the connection. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT establishes SSL connection with the new ACS represented by the new URL. 
    2.  The DUT includes cookie from old ACS to the new ACS in its HTTP POST. 
    3.  The DUT successfully terminates the connection.
