HTTP Authentication - Digest Authentication 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE can successfully establish a CWMP session with the 
ACS using digest authentication. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], a CPE must support Basic Authentication. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Configure both the DUT and the CWMP analyzer to use digest authentication. 
    3.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Send an Authentication Challenge with a status code of “401 Unauthorized” in its HTTP  
        response. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to issue an Inform RPC to the ACS again with the authentication credentials in its 
        HTTP header. 
    4.  Reply with a successful Inform Response. 
    5.  Allow the DUT to successfully terminate the session. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT passes Authentication Challenge by issuing proper authentication credentials to the 
        ACS. 
    2.  The DUT successfully terminates the session.
