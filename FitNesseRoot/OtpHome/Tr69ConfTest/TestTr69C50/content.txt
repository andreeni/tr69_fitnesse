SetParameterAttributes - Passive Notification -Complete and Partial Path 

!4 Purpose:
 
         This test is designed to verify that the CPE can successfully process SetParameterAttributes 
request from the ACS on both complete and partial paths with notification set to Passive. 

!4 Target:
 
         Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

!4 Normative Description:
 
         According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], when the CPE receives a SetParameterAttributes 
request from the ACS on a particular path with notification set to Passive, whenever the specified 
parameter value changes, the CPE must include the new value in the ParameterList in the Inform 
message that is sent the next time a session is established to the ACS. If the path is partial, the new 
attributes are to be applied to all Parameters below this point in the name hierarchy. If the CPE has 
rebooted, or the URL of the ACS has changed since the last session, the CPE can choose to not include 
the changed parameter in the first session established with either the old ACS or the new ACS. 
Test Setup: 
    1.   Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.   Choose two parameter paths, one complete and one partial, from the DUT’s supported data  
         model that contain parameters that can be altered locally from the DUT’s interface. 
    3.   Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.   Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
         exchanges. 
    2.  Schedule a SetParameterAttributes RPC on the DUT on the parameters chosen in test setup step 
         2. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to respond with a SetParameterAttributes response. 
    4.   Modify the parameters represented by the complete path in the request, and one representing a 
         parameter within the name hierarchy of the partial path specified in the request. 
    5.  Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer with a successful Inform 
         exchange. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT can respond with a SetParameterAttributesResponse to the request from the CWMP 
        analyzer. 
    2.  The Inform, after the modification of the parameters, includes the event code “4 VALUE  
        CHANGE”. 
    3.  The Inform, after modification of the parameter, includes the event code of the event that 
        stimulated the DUT to contact the CWMP analyzer. 
    4.  The Inform after the modification includes the changed parameters in the ParameterList in the 
         Inform Message.
