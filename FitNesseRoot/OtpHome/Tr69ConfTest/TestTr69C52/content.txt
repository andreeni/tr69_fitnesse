AddObject 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE is capable of creating an instance of a multi-instance 
object. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

        According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], if an ACS uses AddObject RPC to create a new 
instance of a multi-instance object in the DUT, the DUT should honor the request, perform necessary 
action, create a new instance, and report back to ACS with the instanceNumber of the newly created 
object. The AddObject method call from the ACS takes as an argument the path name of the collection of 
objects for which a new instance is to be created. For example: 
        Top.Group.Object. 
This path name does not include an instance number for the object to be created. The instance number 
is assigned by the CPE and returned in the response. 
Test Setup: 
    1.   Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.   Choose a multi-instance, writable object within the DUTâ€™s supported data model. 
    3.   Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.   Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Schedule an AddObject RPC on the DUT on a parameter of which another instance can be 
        created. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to respond with AddObjectResponse. 
         1.  If the status code in AddObjectResponse is 0, the DUT was successful in creating the 
             parameter. 
         2.  If the status code in AddObjectResponse is 1, the DUT either requires a reboot or other 
             action to create the object. In such case: 
             1.  Allow the DUT to terminate the session with the ACS. 
            2.  Allow the DUT to perform reboot (if required) or other steps necessary to create the 
                 object. 
            3.  Allow the DUT to issue an Inform RPC to the CWMP analyzer in order to establish CWMP 
                 session. 
            4.   Respond with a successful Inform Response 
    4.  Schedule a GetParameterNames RPC with the newly added object as an argument. 
    5.  Allow the DUT to reply back with a GetParameterNamesResponse. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT successfully responds with an AddObjectResponse containing the InstanceNumber of 
        the newly created object and either a 0 or a 1 as the status code. 
    2.  If the status code is 1, the DUT performs all necessary action for addition and contacts the 
        CWMP analyzer again by issuing an Inform RPC once addition is complete. 
    3.  The DUT successfully responds to the GetParameterNames Request without a fault code.
