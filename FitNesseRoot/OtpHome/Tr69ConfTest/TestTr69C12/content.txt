Rejection of Invalid SSL Certificate 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify t hat the CPE does not authenticate a Connection Request from the 
ACS when the SSL certificate is invalid. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS and supports certificate 
authentication of Connection Requests.

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], a CPE MAY use certificate based authentication to 
validate Connection Requests from the ACS.  If the DUT implements this functionality, it must not 
validate Connection Requests from the ACS when the certificate is invalid. 
Test Setup: 
    1.   Configure the CWMP analyzer to use SSL/TLS. 
    2.   Configure the DUT to use the HTTPS URL of the analyzer. 
    3.   Configure the DUT with a pre-determined username and password for authentication. 
    4.   Install mismatched certificates in the DUT and CWMP analyzer. 
    5.   Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Send a Connection RPC on the DUT over https. 
    2.  Allow the DUT to reject the Connection Request from the CWMP analyzer. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT rejects the Connection Request from the CWMP analyzer and does not attempt to 
         establish a session.
