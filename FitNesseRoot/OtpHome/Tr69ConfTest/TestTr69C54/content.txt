Reboot 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE is capable of performing a reboot when instructed by 
the ACS. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

        According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], when an ACS instructs the CPE to perform a reboot by 
issuing the Reboot method call, the CPE must send a successful method response and complete the 
remainder of the session prior to rebooting. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Schedule a Reboot RPC to the DUT. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to reply with a successful RebootResponse. 
    4.  Allow the DUT to terminate the session and perform reboot. 
    5.  Allow the DUT to issue an Inform RPC to the ACS with an event code of “1 BOOT” and “M  
        Reboot”.  

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT successfully responds with a RebootResponse message. 
    2.  The Inform message from DUT after reboot includes the event codes “1 BOOT” and “M Reboot”.
