HTTP Redirection -SSL 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE supports the use of HTTP redirection by the ACS to an 
HTTPS URL. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS. 

!4 References:
 
        [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], if an HTTPS URL is provided in the HTTP redirection 
by the ACS, the CPE must use SSL/TLS as transport mechanism, and establish connection with the HTTPS 
URL. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  If the CWMP analyzer is capable of supporting multiple ACS URLs, configure an alternate https 
        ACS URL on the CWMP analyzer. 
    3.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Issue an HTTP response with a 307 (Temporary Redirect) Status Code and the location of the new 
        HTTPS URL. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to establish an SSL connection with the ACS represented by the new URL. 
    4.  Allow the DUT to issue the same HTTP POST message to the new URL. 
    5.  Using the new URL at the CWMP Analzyer, reply back with an Inform Response. 
    6.  Issue a GetParameterValue RPC on InternetGatewayDevice.ManagementServer.URL to the DUT. 
    7.  Allow the DUT to respond with a GetParameterValueResponse. 
    8.  Analyze the response. The value of the parameter should be the old URL before redirection, and 
        not the new URL. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT establishes SSL connection with the new ACS represented by the new URL. 
    2.  The DUT properly resends the HTTP POST to the redirected URL. 
    3.  The GetParameterValueResponse includes URL of the old ACS.
