DHCP Inform Retry to the DHCP server 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the DUT retries its DHCP INFORM message when it does not 
receive a reply from the DHCP server. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that implements DHCP discovery of the ACS URL. 

!4 References:
 
        [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 
        [2]     RFC 2131 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1] section 3.1, a CWMP enabled CPE must send a DHCP 
INFORM if it cannot communicate with the ACS indicated by the negotiated ACS URL value.  Further, it 
must retry its DHCP INFORM message if it does not receive a DHCPACK from the DHCP server within a 
reasonable time.  This requirement is in accordance with RFC 2131 [2]. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DHCP server or simulator to include the ACS URL in its DHCP options. 
    2.  Configure the DUT to have an empty or null value for the ManagementServer.URL parameter. 
    3.  Connect the DUT, DHCP server or simulator, and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Allow the DUT to request an ACS URL through DHCP. 
    2.  Respond to the DHCP request with a valid response to set the ACS URL. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to attempt to communicate with the CWMP analyzer, without response for 300 
        seconds. 
    4.  Allow the DUT to send a DHCP INFORM, without response for 300 seconds. 
    5.  Allow the DUT to resend the DHCP INFORM. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT sends an initial DHCP INFORM message when receiving no response from the CWMP 
        generator after 300 seconds. 
    2.  The DUT resends the DHCP INFORM message w hen it receives no response for the DHCP server 
        after 300 seconds.
