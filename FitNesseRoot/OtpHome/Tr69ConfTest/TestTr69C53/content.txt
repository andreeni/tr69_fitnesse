DeleteObject 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE is capable of removing a particular instance of an 
object. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

        According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], if an ACS uses DeleteObject RPC to remove a 
particular instance of an object in the DUT, the DUT must honor the request, delete the particular 
instance of the object, and disregard the state previously associated with all Parameters(values and 
attributes) and sub-objects contained within this instance. The DeleteObject method call from the ACS 
takes as an argument the path name of the object instance including the instance number. For example: 
        Top.Group.Object.2. 
 When an object instance is deleted, the instance numbers associated with any other instances of the 
same collection of objects remain unchanged. Thus, the instance numbers of object instances in a 
collection might not be consecutive. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.   Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Schedule a DeleteObject RPC on the DUT on an accessible parameter. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to respond with DeleteObjectResponse. 
         1.  If the status code in DeleteObjectResponse is 0, the DUT was successful in deleting the 
             instance of the parameter. 
         2.  If the status code in DeleteObjectResponse is 1, the DUT either requires a reboot or other 
             action to delete the object. In such case: 
             1.  Allow the DUT to terminate the session with the ACS. 
             2.  Allow the DUT to perform reboot ( if required ) or other DUT specific actions to delete 
                 the object. 
             3.  Allow the DUT to issue an Inform RPC to the ACS in order to establish CWMP session. 
             4.  Respond with a successful Inform Response 
    4.  Schedule a GetParameterNames request on the recently deleted parameter. 
    5.  Allow the DUT to send a GetParameterNamesResponse. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT successfully responds with a DeleteObjectResponse with either a 0 or a 1 as the status 
        code. 
    2.   If the status code is 1, the DUT performs all necessary action for deletion. 
    3.  The DUT responds to the GetParameterNames Request with a fault code.
