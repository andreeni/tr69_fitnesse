Connection Request over SSL/TLS 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE is able to authenticate a Connection Request from the 
ACS over SSL/TLS. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], a CPE MAY use certificate based authentication to 
validate Connection Requests from the ACS. 
Test Setup: 
     1. Configure the CWMP analyzer to use SSL/TLS for Connection Requests. 
     2. Configure the DUT and CWMP analyzer with a pre-determined username and password for 
         authentication. 
     3. Generate and install on the CWMP analyzer a valid certificate for use in authentication with the 
         CPE. 
     4. Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
     1. Send a Connection RPC on the DUT over https. 
     2. Allow the DUT to authenticate the Connection Request. 
     3. Allow the DUT to initiate a session with the CWMP analyzer with successful Inform exchanges. 
     4. Allow the DUT to successfully terminate the session. 
     5. Validate all CWMP messages. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
     1. The DUT authenticates the Connection Request. 
     2. The DUT initiates a CWMP session based on the Connection Request. 
     3. The DUTâ€™s CWMP messages are valid. 
     4. The DUT successfully terminates the session.
