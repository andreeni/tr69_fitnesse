Multiple TCP Connections Across a Single CWMP session 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that ACS and CPE can maintain multiple TCP connections over a 
single CWMP session. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

        [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], for a sequence of transactions forming a single 
session, a CPE should maintain a TCP connection that persists throughout the duration of the session. 
However, if the TCP connection is cleanly closed after an HTTP request/response round trip, and if the 
session has not otherwise terminated (either successfully or unsuccessfully) at the time of the last HTTP 
response, the CPE MUST continue the session by sending the next HTTP request in a new TCP 
connection. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Reply with an Authentication Challenge containing “Connection:close” in its header. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to close its existing TCP connection. 
    4.  Allow the DUT to issue an Inform RPC to the ACS again ( with the “Authentication” HTTP header)  
        in order to establish a CWMP session. 
    5.  Respond to the Inform RPC with a successful InformResponse. 
    6.  Allow the DUT to terminate the session. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT closes its existing TCP connection and sends the second HTTP request (with the 
        “Authentication” header) in a new TCP connection.
