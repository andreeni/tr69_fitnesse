ACS Modifies URL 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the DUT accepts, interprets, and utilizes a new ACS URL set by 
the ACS via CWMP. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS. 

!4 References:
 
         [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], once the CPE has established a connection to the 
ACS, the ACS may at any time modify the ACS address Parameter stored within the CPE. Once modified, 
the CPE must use the modified address for all subsequent connections to the ACS. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Configure an alternate instance or ACS URL on the CWMP analyzer. 
    3.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.   Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Schedule a SetParameterValues RPC on the DUT using the CWMP generator, setting the value of 
        the Management.URL parameter to the value of the alternate URL provided in the test setup. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to attempt to communicate with the CWMP analyzer at the new URL. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT accepts, interprets and utilizes the new ACS URL.
