!2 ACS Discovery using DHCP

!4 Purpose: 
This test is designed to verify that the DUT attempts to use DHCP to discover the ACS URL when the DUT has no value for the ManagementServer.URL

!4 Target:
Any CWMP enabled CPE that implements DHCP discovery of the ACS URL.

!4 Normative Description:
 According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], a CWMP enabled CPE must use DHCP to attempt to discover the ACS URL when the CPE has no value (empty or null) for the parameter ManagementServer.URL . A CPE identifies itself to the DHCP server as supporting this method by including the string “dslforum.org” (all lower case) anywhere in the Vendor Class Identifier ( DHCP option 60 ). The CPE may then use the values received from the DHCP server in the Vendor Specific Information ( DHCP option 43 )to set the URL of the ACS and the Provisioning Code.


!4 Test Setup:
 1. Configure the DHCP server or simulator to include the ACS URL in its DHCP options.
 2. Configure the DUT to have an empty or null value for the ManagementServer.URL parameter.
 3. Connect the DUT, DHCP server or simulator, and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure.




!4 Procedure:
 1. Allow the DUT to request an ACS URL using DHCP.
 2. Respond to the DHCP request with a valid response to set the ACS URL.
 3. Allow the DUT to use the value received from the DHCP server in the Vendor Specification Information ( DHCP option 43 ) to set the ManagementServer.URL
 4. Allow the DUT to establish a CWMP session with the ACS specified by the URL.
 5. Allow the DUT to terminate the session.
