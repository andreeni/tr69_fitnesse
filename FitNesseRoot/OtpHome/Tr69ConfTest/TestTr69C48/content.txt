SetParameterAttributes - Passive Notification -Complete Path 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE can successfully process SetParameterAttributes 
request from the ACS on a complete path with notification set to Passive. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], when the CPE receives a SetParameterAttributes 
request from the ACS on a complete path with notification set to Passive, whenever the specified 
parameter value changes, the CPE must include the new value in the ParameterList in the Inform 
message that is sent the next time a session is established to the ACS. If the CPE has rebooted, or the 
URL of the ACS has changed since the last session, the CPE can choose to not include the changed 
parameter in the first session established with either the old ACS or the new ACS. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Choose a parameter from the DUT’s supported data model that can be altered locally from the  
         DUT’s interface. 
    3.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.   Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Schedule a SetParameterAttributes RPC on the DUT on the parameter chosen in test setup step 
        2. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to respond with a SetParameterAttributes response. 
    4.   Modify the parameter locally in the DUT. 
    5.  Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer with a successful Inform 
        exchange. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT can respond with a SetParameterAttributesResponse to the request from the CWMP 
        analyzer. 
    2.  The Inform, after the modification of the parameter, includes the event code “4 VALUE CHANGE”. 
    3.  The Inform, after modification of the parameter, includes the event code of the event that 
        stimulated the DUT to contact the CWMP analyzer. 
    4.  The Inform after the modification includes the changed parameter in the ParameterList in the 
        Inform Message.
