Handling Null Terminated ACS URL obtained from DHCP Server 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the DUT correctly interprets and acts upon the ACS URL used. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that implements DHCP discovery of the ACS URL. 

!4 References:
 
        [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 
        [2]     RFC 2131 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1] section 3.1, a CWMP enabled CPE must handle a null 
terminated ACS URL by accepting the URL as valid, without including the null terminating character in 
the URL. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DHCP server or simulator to include the ACS URL in its DHCP options. 
    2.  Configure the DUT to have an empty or null value for the ManagementServer.URL parameter. 
    3.  Connect the DUT, DHCP server or simulator, and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Allow the DUT to request an ACS URL through DHCP. 
    2.  Respond to the DHCP request with a valid response to set the ACS URL with a URL that is null- 
        terminated. 
    3.  Verify that the DUT has correctly interpreted the URL. 
    4.  Allow the DUT to attempt to communicate with the ACS at the new URL. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT interprets the ACS URL without the null-termination. 
    2.  The DUT attempts a secure connection to the CWM P analyzer.
