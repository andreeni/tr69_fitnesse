SetParameterValues -Multiple Parameters 

!4 Purpose:
 
        T This test is designed to verify that the CPE supports the required SetParameterValues RPC and 
can change multiple parameters in a single procedure call. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

        According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], if an ACS calls SetParameterValues on a DUT, the DUT 
must support the request and respond appropriately. On successful receipt of a SetParameterValues RPC, 
the CPE must apply the changes to all of the specified Parameters atomically. That is, either all of the 
value changes are applied together, or none of the changes are applied at all. In the latter case, the CPE 
must return a fault response indicating the reason for the failure to apply the changes. The CPE must not 
apply any of the specified changes without applying all of them. This requirement must hold true even if 
the CPE experiences a crash during the process of applying the changes. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Choose at least two valid, writable parameters from the DUTâ€™s supported data model. 
    3.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    7.  Allow the DUT toEstablish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with 
        successful Inform exchanges. 
    8.  Instruct the ACS to respond with a successful Inform Response. 
    9.  Schedule a SetParameterValues RPC on the DUT on a writable parameter. 
    10. Allow the DUT to respond with SetParameterValuesResponse. 
             a.  If the he status code in SetParameterValuesResponse is 0, it means the DUT can change 
                 the parameter immediately. 
             b.  If the status code in SetParameterValuesResponse is 1, it means the DUT requires a 
                 reboot to apply the change to the parameter. In this case: 
                      i. Allow the DUT to terminate session with the ACS. 
                     ii. Allow the DUT to apply the change and reboot. 
    11.  Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    12. Schedule a GetParameterValues RPC on the DUT on the same parameter that was used for 
        SetParameterValues. 
    13. Analyze the value. The value should be the new changed value. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT successfully changes the value of the parameter and reports the correct changed value 
        in subsequent GetParameterValues request.
