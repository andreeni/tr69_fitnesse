GetParameterNames -Entire Object Model 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE can communicate its entire object model to the ACS. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], when ParameterPath argument in the 
GetParameterNames is set to the root object in the DUT’s data model (i.e., “InternetGatewayDevice.”, or  
“Device.”), and next level argument in GetParameterNames is set to false, the response must contain the 
entire object model supported by the DUT. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Schedule a GetParameterNames RPC on the DUT using a partial path and next level set to true. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to respond with GetParameterNamesResponse. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The CPE can respond with its entire object model to the ACS.
