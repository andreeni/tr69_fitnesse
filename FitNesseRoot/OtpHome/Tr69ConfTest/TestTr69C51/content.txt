SetParameterAttributes -Disable Notification 

!4 Purpose:
 
         This test is designed to verify that the CPE is capable of disabling previously set notification 
attribute. 

!4 Target:
 
         Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

         According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], when the CPE receives a SetParameterAttributes 
request from the ACS on a particular path with notification set to 0 (disable notification), the CPE must 
cease informing the ACS of value change events on that parameter. 
Test Setup: 
     1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
     2.  Choose a parameter path (complete or partial) in the DUTâ€™s supported data model that is current 
         set for either active or passive notification. 
     3.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
     1.  Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
         exchanges. 
     2.  Instruct the ACS to respond with a successful Inform Response. 
     3.  Instruct the ACS to send a SetParameterAttributes on a complete path or a partial path with 
         notification set to 0 (disable notification). 
     4.  Allow the DUT to respond with SetParameterAttributes response. 
     5.  Modify the parameters represented by a complete path if specified in the request, or one 
         representing a parameter within the name hierarchy of a partial path if specified in the request. 
     6.  Ensure the DUT does not communicate an event to the CWMP analyzer indicating a change in 
         the parameter. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
     1.  The DUT can respond with a SetParameterAttributesResponse to the request from the CWMP 
         analyzer. 
    2.  The DUT does not communicate an event to the CWMP analyzer indicated a change in the 
        parameter.
