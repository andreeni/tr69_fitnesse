ScheduleInform Test 

!4 Purpose:
 
        The purpose of this test is to verify that the CPE is able to schedule a one-time Inform method 
call when requested by the CWMP analyzer using ScheduleInform Test. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], if an ACS issues a ScheduleInform RPC, the CPE may 
schedule a one-time Inform method call sometime in the future. The time the CPE must wait before 
issuing an Inform message is specified as a parameter in the ScheduleInform request. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Choose a time interval between 60 and 300 seconds for the DUT to perform the scheduled 
        inform. 
    3.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.   Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Instruct the CWMP analyzer to issue a ScheduleInform to the DUT. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to respond with a successful ScheduleInformResponse. 
    4.  Wait for the DUT to issue an Inform RPC to the CWMP analyzer. 
    5.  Respond with a successful Inform Response. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT successfully responds with a ScheduleInformResponse message. 
    2.  The DUT issues an Inform RPC to the CWMP analyzer with event code “3 SCHEDULED”
