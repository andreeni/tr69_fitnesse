ACS Rediscovery using DHCP 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the DUT consistently utilizes DHCP to discover the ACS URL. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that implements DHCP discovery of the ACS URL. 

!4 References:
 
         [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 
         [2]     RFC 2131 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1] section 3.1, a CWMP enabled CPE must utilize the 
same method for acquiring an ACS URL that it was originally configured to use, regardless of the 
mechanism used to change the ACS URL at a later point. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DHCP server or simulator to include the ACS URL in its DHCP options. 
    2.  Configure the DUT to have an empty or null value for the ManagementServer.URL parameter. 
    3.  Connect the DUT, DHCP server or simulator, and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Allow the DUT to request an ACS URL through DHCP. 
    2.   Respond to the DHCP request using the generator with a valid response to set the ACS URL. 
    3.  Set the ACS URL through a manual mechanism. 
    4.  Allow the DUT to attempt to communicate with the ACS at the new URL, without response. 
    5.  Allow the DUT to attempt to rediscover the ACS URL via DHCP. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
     1. The DUT attempts to rediscover the ACS URL via DHCP when it had previously set the ACS URL 
         via DHCP and cannot communicate with the ACS.
