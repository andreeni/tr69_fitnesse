SOAP Fault Format 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the SOAP Fault response enclosed inside a SOAP envelope is 
formed properly. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS. 

!4 References:
 
        [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], a fault response from the CPE must make use of the 
following conventions: 
     The SOAP faultcode element must indicate the source of the fault, either Client or Server, as 
        appropriate for the particular fault. In the example used below, Client represents the originator 
        of the SOAP request, and Server represents the SOAP responder. 
     The SOAP faultstring sub-element must contain the string “CWMP fault”.  
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Instruct the CWMP analyzer to issue an arbitrary RPC not supported by the CPE. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to respond with a SOAP Fault. 
    4.  Analyze the SOAP Fault. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The SOAP faultcode element indicates the source of fault with either “Server” or “Client”.  
    2.  The SOAP faultstring sub-element contains the string “CWMP fault”.
