GetParameterValues -Entire Object Model 

!4 Purpose:
 
         This test is designed to verify that the CPE can respond to a GetParameterValues request by the 
ACS on a partial path representing the top level in the datamodel with the entire object model. 

!4 Target:
 
         Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

         According to BroadBand Forum[1], a CPE must be able to respond to a GetParameterValues 
Request from an ACS when the argument is an array of strings, each representing the name of a 
requested parameter.     If the parameter name argument is given as a partial path name, the request is to 
be interpreted as a RPC on return all of the Parameters in the branch of the naming hierarchy that shares 
the same prefix as the argument.  A partial path name must end with a “.”(dot) after the last node name 
in the hierarchy.  An empty string indicates the top of the name hierarchy. 
         Unlike the GetParameterNames RPC, a CPE may reject a GetParameterValues call on the entire 
object model.  However, it may only do so due to a “9004 Resources Exceeded” error. 
Test Setup: 
     1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
     2.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
     1.  Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
         exchanges. 
     2.  Schedule a GetParameterValues RPC on the DUT using a partial path, such the partial path 
         indicates the top level in the data model. 
     3.  Allow the DUT to respond with GetParameterValuesResponse or the “9004 Resources Exceeded”  
         error. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
     1.  The CPE can properly respond to the CWMP analyzer with the entire object model, or throws the 
         correct error if it cannot do so.
