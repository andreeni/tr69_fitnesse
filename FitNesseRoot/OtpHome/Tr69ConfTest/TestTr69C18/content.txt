SOAP Response in an HTTP Request 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the SOAP Response is encoded properly in an HTTP Request 
Message. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS. 

!4 References:
 
         [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], when there is a SOAP response in an HTTP Request, or 
when there is a SOAP Fault response in an HTTP Request, the SOAPAction header in the HTTP Request 
must have no value, indicating that this header provides no information as to the intent of the message. 
That is, it must appear as follows: 
        SOAPAction: 
         In addition to that, when an HTTP Request contains a SOAP Envelope, the HTTP Content-Type 
header must have a type/subtype of ”text/xml”  
Test Setup: 
    1.   Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.   Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.   Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.   Instruct the ACS to issue a valid RPC RPC on the DUT. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to respond to the RPC request. 
    4.  Analyze the  HTTP POST message containing the SOAP response. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The HTTP POST message has an empty SOAPAction header, and the HTTP Content-type header 
         must have a type/subtype of “text/xml”.
