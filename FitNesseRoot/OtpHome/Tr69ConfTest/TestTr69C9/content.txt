Connection after PeriodicInformInterval 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE attempts to establish a connection with the ACS after 
a time period equal to PeriodicInformInterval. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], the CPE MUST establish connection to the ACS after 
PeriodicInformInterval (example, after every 60 seconds).    This is differentiated from a CPE connecting to 
an ACS for the first time, or a CPE connecting to the ACS after reboot. 
        All CWMP sessions begin with the use of the Inform RPC.     Each Inform RPC contains event codes 
in its arguments that indicate the event which caused the session to be initiated.  In this case, the 
behavior is indicated by the event code “2 PERIODIC”. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Choose a short value for the PeriodicInformInterval, between 60 and 300 seconds.  Configure 
        the DUT to use this value for PeriodicInformInterval. 
    3.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.   Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
    3.  Wait for the PeriodicInformInterval determined in test setup step 2. 
    4.  Allow the DUT to initiate a session with the CWMP analyzer with successful Inform exchanges. 
    5.  Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
    6.  After the period determined in test setup step 2 has expired, allow the DUT initiate a new 
        session. 
    7.   Respond to the Inform RPC with an appropriate InformResponse. 
    8.  Allow the DUT to successfully terminate the session. 
    9.  Validate all CWMP messages. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT attempts to re-establish a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer after the 
        predetermined PeriodicInformInterval by sending an Inform message with an event code of “2  
        PERIODIC”.  
    2.  The DUT’s CWMP messages are valid. 
    3.  The DUT successfully terminates the session.
