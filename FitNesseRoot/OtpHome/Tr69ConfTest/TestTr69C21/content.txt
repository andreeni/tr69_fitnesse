HTTP Redirection - Multiple Redirections 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE allows up to 5 consecutive redirections. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CP E that communicates directly with the ACS. 

!4 References:
 
         [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], a CPE must allow up to 5 consecutive redirections. If 
the CPE is redirected more than 5 times consecutively, it may consider the session unsuccessfully 
terminated. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.   If the CWMP analyzer is capable of supporting multiple ACS URLs, configure an alternate ACS 
         URL on the CWMP analyzer. 
    3.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.   Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.   Issue an HTTP response with a 307 (Temporary Redirect) Status Code and the location of the new 
         URL. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to issue the same HTTP POST message to the new URL. 
    4.   Issue an HTTP response with a 307 (Temporary Redirect) Status Code and the location of the old 
         URL again. 
    5.   Repeat the back and forth process for two more times, so that the redirection count now is 4. 
    6.   Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer. 
    7.   Issue an HTTP response with a 307 (Temporary Redirect) Status Code and the location of the new 
         URL. 
    8.   Using the new URL at the CWMP analyzer, reply back with an Inform Response. 
    9.  Allow the DUT to close the connection. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT honors each redirection request and sends an HTTP post to the redirected URL. 
    2.  The DUT successfully terminates the connection.
