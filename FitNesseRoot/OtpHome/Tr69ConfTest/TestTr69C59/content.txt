CWMP Faults -Basic RPC Faults 

!4 Purpose:
 
         The purpose of this test is to verify that the DUT is capable of rejecting RPCs that it does not 
support. 

!4 Target:
 
         Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

!4 Normative Description:
 
        Section A.5.1 of Broadband Forum TR-069[1] specifies the CWMP Fault codes that can be 
returned by the CPE in a variety of circumstances.    These faults, listed in Table 65 of [1], consist of a fault 
code which must be used as the value of the SOAP fault code element, as well as arguments that may be 
required as part of the fault’s functionality.  Different fault codes are allowed or required for each of the  
RPCs described in CWMP. 
        This test exercises the basic fault, “9000 - Method not supported”. 
Test Setup: 
    1.   Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.   Choose a valid RPC that is not listed as supported by the DUT. 
    3.   Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.   Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
         exchanges. 
    2.  Schedule a GetRPCMethods RPC on the DUT with the CWMP analyzer. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to respond with GetRPCMethodsResponse message. 
    4.   Ensure that the RPC selected in test setup step 2 is not listed in the GetRPCMethodsResponse. 
    5.  Schedule the RPC selected in test setup step 2 on the DUT with the CWMP analyzer. 
    6.  Allow the DUT to respond with fault “9000 - Method not supported”. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT rejects an RPC that it does not support. 
    2.  The fault is correctly formed.
