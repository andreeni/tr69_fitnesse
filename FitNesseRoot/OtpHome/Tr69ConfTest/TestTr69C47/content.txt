SetParameterAttributes -Active Notifications 

!4 Purpose:
 
         This test is designed to verify that the CPE can successfully process SetParameterAttributes 
request from the ACS on a complete path with notification set to Active. 

!4 Target:
 
         Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

!4 Normative Description:
 
         According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], when the CPE receives a SetParameterAttributes 
request from the ACS on a complete path with notification set to Active, the CPE must initiate a session 
to the ACS, and include the new value in the ParameterList in the associated Inform message when the 
specified parameter value changes. 
Test Setup: 
     1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
     2.  Choose a parameter from the DUT’s supported data model that can be altered locally from the  
         DUT’s interface and is capable of performing active notification. 
     3.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
     1.  Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
         exchanges. 
     2.  Schedule a SetParameterAttributes RPC on the selected parameter with notification set to Active 
         (2). 
     3.  Allow the DUT to respond with SetParameterAttributes response. 
     4.  Modify the parameter in the DUT. 
     5.  Allow the DUT to initiate a new session with the ACS by sending an Inform message. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
     1.  The DUT can respond with a SetParameterAttributesResponse to the request from the ACS. 
     2.  The Inform after the modification of the parameter includes the event code “4 VALUE CHANGE”. 
     3.  The Inform after the modification includes the changed parameter in the ParameterList in the 
         Inform Message.
