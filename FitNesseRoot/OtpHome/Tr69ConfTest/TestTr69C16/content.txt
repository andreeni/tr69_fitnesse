Use of Session Cookies Across Multiple Transactions in a Session 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE can successfully interact using cookies across multiple 
CWMP sessions. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS. 

!4 References:
 
         [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], a CPE must support the use of cookies including the 
return of the cookie value in each subsequent HTTP POST, with the exception that a CPE need not 
support storage of cookies beyond the duration of a session. The CPE must support the compatibility 
requirements of section 9.1 of [7]. The CPE must support the use of multiple cookies by the ACS, and 
must make available at least 512 bytes for storage of cookies. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Configure the CWMP analyzer to use session cookies. 
    3.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Set the HTTP cookie in the HTTP response. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to send an empty HTTP POST or an Inform RPC to the CWMP analyzer. 
    4.  Analyze the HTTP message from the DUT to check if it is using the cookie sent in the POST. 
    5.  Allow the DUT to terminate the session. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT returns the cookie value in each subsequent HTTP POST after the cookie has been set.
