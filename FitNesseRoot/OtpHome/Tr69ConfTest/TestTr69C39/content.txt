GetParameterValues -Complete and Partial Paths 

!4 Purpose:
 
         This test is designed to verify that the CPE can respond to a GetParameterValues request by the 
ACS on both complete and partial paths. 

!4 Target:
 
         Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

         According to BroadBand Forum[1], a CPE must be able to respond to a GetParameterValues 
Request from an ACS when the argument is an array of strings, each representing the name of a 
requested parameter.    If the parameter name argument is given as a partial path, the request is to be 
interpreted as a RPC to return all of the Parameters in the branch of the naming hierarchy that shares the 
same prefix as the argument. A partial path name must end with a “.”(dot) after the last node name in 
the hierarchy.  An empty string indicates the top of the name hierarchy. 
Test Setup: 
    1.   Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.   Choose two valid parameter paths from the DUT’s supported data model, one partial and one  
         complete path. 
    3.   Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.   Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
         exchanges. 
    2.   Schedule a GetParameterValues RPC on the DUT using both a complete path and a partial path. 
    3.   Allow the DUT to respond with GetParameterValuesResponse. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.   The CPE can properly respond to GetParameterValues request by the ACS on both complete and 
         partial path.
