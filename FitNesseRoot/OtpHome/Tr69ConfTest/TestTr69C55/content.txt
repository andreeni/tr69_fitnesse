Download Test -Basic Version Upgrade 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE is capable of peforming the Download RPC and apply 
the new software or firmware image. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

        According to the Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], when Download method call is used by the ACS 
instructing the CPE to download a specified file from the designated location, the CPE must indicate 
successful or unsuccessful completion of the download using one of the following three means: 
     A download Response with the status argument having a value of 0 (indicating success), or a 
        fault response to the Download request (indicating failure). 
     A TransferComplete RPC called later in the same session as the Download request(indicating 
        either success or failure). In this case, the Status argument in the corresponding 
         DownloadResponse must have a value of 1. 
     A TransferComplete RPC made in a subsequent session (indicating either a success or failure). In 
        this case, the Status argument in the corresponding DownloadResponse must have a value of 1. 
Regardless of which mechanism is used, the CPE must only indicate successful completion of the 
download after the downloaded file has both been successfully transferred and applied. If the 
downloaded file is a software image, the CPE must consider the downloaded file to be successfully 
applied only after the new software image is actually installed and operational. If the software image 
replaces the overall software of the CPE (which would typically require a reboot to install and begin 
execution), the SoftwareVersion represented in the data model must already reflect the updated 
software image in the session in which the CPE makes a TransferComplete RPC on the ACS indicating 
successful download. 
If the CPE requires a reboot to apply the downloaded file, then the only appropriate means of indicating 
successful completion is the third option listed above - a TransferComplete message sent in a 
subsequent session. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Obtain a firmware image for the DUT that, while structurally identical to the operating firmware 
        under test, contains a different image version number. 
    3.   Configure and provide a file server (i.e., http or ftp) that can be accessed by DUT through the 
         network infrastructure.  Authentication may or may not be configured on the file server. 
    4.   Copy the provided firmware image to the file server. 
    5.   Connect all components of the test setup to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
     1.  Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
         exchanges. 
    2.   Schedule a Download RPC with the following arguments: 
         CommandKey                                          Empty String 
         FileType                                            “1 Firmware Upgrade Image” 
         URL                                                 Location of the firmware image 
                                                             Username to be used by the CPE to 
         Username 
                                                             authenticate with the file server (if any). 
                                                             Password to be used by the CPE to 
         Password 
                                                             authenticate with the file server (if any). 
         FileSize                                           The size of the file to be downloaded in bytes. 
         TargetFileName                                     The name of the firmware image 
                                                            A random time between 60 and 120 seconds. 
         DelaySeconds                                       This exercises the device’s ability to wait  
                                                             before performing the download. 
         SuccessURL                                          Empty string 
         FailureURL                                          Empty string 
    3.   Allow the DUT to respond with DownloadResponse. 
         a)  A status code of 0 in the DownloadResponse means the DUT successfully finished download 
             and applied the change. 
         b)  A status code of 1 means the DUT will need time to download the file or need certain actions 
             like Reboot to complete the download. In such case: 
             1.  Allow the DUT to finish downloading the firmware image. Allow the DUT to reboot if 
                 needed. 
             2.  If the session has not been terminated, allow the DUT to send a TransferComplete 
                 message in the same session. 
             3.  If the session has been terminated (as a result of reboot or similar action), allow the DUT 
                 to initiate a connection with the ACS by sending an Inform message and instruct the ACS 
                 to respond with a successful InformResponse. 
    4.   Issue a GetParameterValues request from the ACS to the DUT on SoftwareVersion parameter to 
        verify if the new firmware image has been applied by the DUT. 
    5.  Allow the DUT to respond with a GetParameterValues Response. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT successfully responds to the Download RPC with a DownloadResponse. 
    2.  The DUT performs the Download. 
    3.  The DUT performs the firmware upgrade. 
    4.   If the upgrade was performed after the session has closed, in the Inform following the upgrade, 
        the DUT includes the events “7 TRANSFER COMPLETE” and “M Download”. 
    5.  The version information given in the same Inform contains the NEW firmware version. 
    6.  The DUT makes the TransferComplete RPC to indicate the Download was successful.
