Persistent TCP Connection Across a Single CWMP session 

!4 Purpose:
 
        The purpose of this test is to verify that the ACS and CPE can maintain a persistent TCP 
connection across multiple CWMP sessions. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

        [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], when a CPE receives an authentication challenge 
from ACS, the CPE must send the next HTTP request (including the “Authorization” HTTP header) in the  
same TCP connection. The authentication challenge from the ACS must not have “Connection:close” in  
the HTTP header. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Reply with an Authentication Challenge. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to issue an Inform RPC to the ACS again (with the “Authentication” HTTP header)  
        in order to establish a CWMP session. 
    4.  Respond to the Inform RPC with a successful InformResponse. 
    5.  Allow the DUT to terminate the session. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT must not close its existing TCP connection and must send the second HTTP request 
        (with the “Authentication” header) in the same TCP connection.
