Session Initiation and Termination 

!4 Purpose:
 
         This test is designed to verify that the CPE is able to initiate and terminate a session properly. 

!4 Target:
 
         Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS. 

!4 References:
 
         [1]      Broadband Forum TR-069 

!4 Normative Description:
 
         According to Broadband Forum TR-069[1], once a connection between a CPE and an ACS is 
established, the CPE initiates a session by sending an initial Inform RPC on the ACS in an HTTP POST 
message. If and only if the CPE receives a successful Inform response to the Inform Request, the CPE 
considers the session to have been successfully initiated. Once initiated, the CPE must terminate the 
transaction session only when all of the following conditions are met: 
      The ACS has no further requests to send the CPE. The CPE concludes this if and only if the most 
         recent HTTP response from the ACS was empty. 
      The CPE has no further requests to send to the ACS and the CPE has issued an empty HTTP POST 
         to the ACS while HoldRequests is false (which indicates to the ACS that the CPE has no further 
         requests for the remainder of the session). As defined in Table 6, if this condition has not been 
         met but the CPE has no further requests or responses, it MUST send an empty HTTP POST, which 
         will then fulfill this condition. 
      The CPE has received all outstanding response messages from the ACS. 
      The CPE has sent all outstanding response messages to the ACS resulting from prior requests. 
Figure below is an example of a session. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the CPE to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Connect the CPE, and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Stimulate the CPE to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Reply with a successful Inform Response. 
    3.  Allow the CPE to respond with an empty HTTP POST. 
    4.  Make a valid RPC RPC on the CPE. 
    5.  Allow the CPE to respond with a valid response to the RPC request. 
    6.  Verify if the CPE used the existing TCP connection. 
    7.  Respond with an empty HTTP POST. 
    8.  Allow the CPE to close the connection. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The CPE does not close existing TCP connection when replying to the RPC request. 
    2.  The CPE closes existing TCP connection after receiving empty HTTP POST from the  CWMP 
        Analyzer.
