Connection Establishment using SSL/TLS 

!4 Purpose:
 
         This test is designed to verify that the CPE is able to establish a connection with the ACS using 
SSL or TLS. 

!4 Target:
 
         Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1] section 3.3, a CPE must support SSL, TLS, or both, in 
order to facilitate secure communication.  In addition, if at any time the ACS URL is specified with an 
“https” prefix, the CPE must attempt to establish a connection utilizing SSL/TLS. 
        This test utilizes this second required functionality to stimulate the DUT to attempt a connection 
using SSL/TLS.  This is included in the test metrics. 
Test Setup: 
    1.   Configure the CWMP analyzer to use SSL/TLS. 
    2.   Configure the DUT to use the HTTPS URL of the analyzer. 
    3.   Configure the DUT with a pre-determined username and password for authentication. 
    4.   Generate and install on the DUT a valid certificate for use in authentication with the CWMP 
         analyzer. 
    5.   Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.   Stimulate the DUT to send a CWMP Inform message to the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.   Respond to the Inform Request with an InformResponse. 
    3.   Allow the DUT to successfully terminate the session. 
    4.   Validate all CWMP messages. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.   The DUT attempts to establish a session by sending an Inform message. 
    2.   The DUT’s CWMP messages are valid. 
    3.   The DUT successfully terminates the session.
