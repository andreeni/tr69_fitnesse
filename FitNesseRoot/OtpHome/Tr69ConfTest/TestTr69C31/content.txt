GetParameterNames -Complete Path 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE is capable of responding to a simple complete path 
request made by the ACS to determine its accessibility. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], a CPE must support the following required RPCs, and 
may optionally support other RPCs: GetRPCMethods, SetParameterValues , SetParameterValues, 
GetParameterNames, SetParameterAttributes, GetParameterAttributes, AddObject, DeleteObject, 
Reboot, Download. 
        The GetParameterNames RPC is used to determine the availability of parameters in the CPEs 
data model and their access level.  The RPC can a complete or partial path as its argument; this test 
exercises the ability to complete the GetParameterNames RPC using a complete parameter path. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Respond with a successful Inform Response. 
    3.  Schedule a GetParameterNames RPC on the DUT using complete path name of any parameter 
        supported by the DUT. 
    4.  Allow the DUT to respond with GetParameterNamesResponse. 
 
!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The CPE is able to respond to the GetParameterNames request from the CWMP analyzer with a 
        response that includes the complete path of the requested parameter and whether the 
        parameter is writable or not.
