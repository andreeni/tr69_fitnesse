Handling DNS server response 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the DUT does not cache the DNS server response beyond the 
duration of time to live (TTL) returned by DNS server. 

!4 Target:
 
        The type of CWMP enabled equipment valid for the test. 

!4 References:
 
        [1]    Broadband Forum TR-069 
        [2]    DNS RFC 1034 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], the CPE must not cache the DNS server response 
beyond the duration of time to live (TTL) returned by DNS server unless it cannot contact the DNS server 
for an update. This behavior is required by DNS RFC 1034 and provides an opportunity for the DNS 
Server to update stale data. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DHCP server or simulator to include the ACS URL in its DHCP options. 
    2.  Configure the DUT to have an empty or null value for the ManagementServer.URL parameter. 
    3.  Connect the DUT, DNS server, DHCP server, and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Allow the DUT to request an ACS URL through DHCP. 
    2.  Respond to the DHCP request using the generator with a valid response to set the ACS URL. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to contact the DNS server to resolve the ACS URL. 
    6.  Set a new ACS URL through a manual mechanism. 
    7.  Allow the DUT to attempt to communicate with the ACS at the new URL, without response. 
    8.  Allow the DUT to attempt to rediscover the ACS URL via DHCP after the TTL specified in the DNS 
        response has expired. 
    9.  Respond to the rediscover request with a valid response to set the ACS URL. 
    10. Allow the DUT to contact the DNS server again to resolve the ACS URL. 
    11. Allow the DUT to establish a CWMP session with the ACS. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT contacts the DNS server again to resolve the ACS URL without caching the previous 
        response from the DNS server.
