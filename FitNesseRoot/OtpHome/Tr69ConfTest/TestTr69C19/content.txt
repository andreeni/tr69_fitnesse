HTTP Redirection Test -302 Redirect 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE supports the use of HTTP redirection by the ACS using 
the 302 (Found) status code. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS. 

!4 References:
 
        [1]     Broadband Forum TR-069 

!4 Normative Description:
 
        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], a CPE must support the use of HTTP redirection by 
the ACS. In doing so, the CPE must support the 302(Found) HTTP status code. In case of redirection, the 
CPE must attempt to continue the session using the URL provided in the HTTP redirect response. The CPE 
must resend the HTTP POST that resulted in the redirect response to the ACS at the redirected URL, and 
the CPE must then attempt to proceed with the session exactly as if no redirection had occurred. The 
redirected URL must not be saved by the CPE (i.e. as the value of the IGD.ManagementServer.URL) for 
use in any subsequent session or any subsequent retries of the session. 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  If the CWMP analyzer is capable of supporting multiple ACS URLs, configure an alternate ACS 
        URL on the CWMP analyzer. 
    3.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.  Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Issue an HTTP response with a 302(Found) Status Code and the location of the new URL. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to issue the same HTTP POST message to the new URL. 
    4.  Using the new URL at the CWMP analyzer, reply back with an Inform Response. 
    5.  Issue a GetParameterValue RPC on InternetGatewayDevice.ManagementServer.URL to the DUT. 
    6.  Allow the DUT to respond with a GetParameterValueResponse. 
    7.  Analyze the response. The value of the parameter should be the old URL before redirection, and 
        not the new URL. 
    8.  Allow the DUT to close the connection. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The DUT properly resends the HTTP POST to the redirected URL. 
    2.  The GetParameterValueResponse includes URL of the old ACS.
