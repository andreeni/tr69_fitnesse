GetParameterNames -Partial Path -Next Level True 

!4 Purpose:
 
        This test is designed to verify that the CPE is capable of responding to a partial path request 
made by the ACS when next level is set to true. 

!4 Target:
 
        Any CWMP enabled CPE that communicates directly with the ACS.

        According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], when next level argument in GetParameterNames is 
set to true, the response from the DUT must contain all parameters and objects that are next-level 
children of the object given by the ParameterPath argument, if any. For example, if ParameterPath were 
“InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.1.Hosts.”, the response would include the following:  
         InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.1.Hosts.HostNumberOfEntries 
         InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.1.Hosts.Host 
Test Setup: 
    1.  Configure the DUT to use the ACS URL set on the CWMP analyzer. 
    2.  Connect the DUT and CWMP analyzer to the network infrastructure. 

!4 Procedure:
 
    1.   Establish a CWMP session between the CWMP analyzer and DUT with successful Inform 
        exchanges. 
    2.  Schedule a GetParameterNames RPC on the DUT using a partial path and next level set to true. 
    3.  Allow the DUT to respond with GetParameterNamesResponse. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
    1.  The CPE is able to successfully respond to the partial path request including on ly the next level.
