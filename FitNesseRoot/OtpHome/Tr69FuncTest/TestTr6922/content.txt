Test TR69.2.2:    IP Ping Diagnostics Test 

!4 Purpose:
    This test is designed to verify that the DUT can successfully perform an IP Ping Diagnostics 
Test as defined in Broadband Forum TR-098 [3].

!4 Resource Requirements:
 
          -   CPE (DUT) 
          -   CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

!4 Test setup:
 
          1.    Test Setup 1 or 2 

!4 Discussion:
 
          Broadband Forum TR-098 [3] defines an object and set of parameters for performing a simple 
diagnostics test utilizing the ICMP [4] based "ping" application.     The test is initiated by the ACS using a 
SetParameterValues remote procedure call that changes the value of the DiagnosticsState parameter in the 
IPPingDiagnostics object to a value of "Requested".      The CPE then performs the diagnostic test; generally 
after the CWMP session terminates successfully. 
          This test uses the following values for the write-enabled parameters in the IPPingDiagnostics 
object: 
          1.    Host: set to the IP address of the CWMP Analyzer 
          2.   NumberofRepetitions: 10 
          3.   Timeout: 1000 
          4.   DataBlockSize: 64 
          5.   DSCP: 0 
          Upon conclusion of the test, the CPE initiates a CWMP session with an event code of "8 
DIAGNOSTICS COMPLETE" in the Inform arguments. 

!4 Procedure:
 
     1.    Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     2.    Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP connection with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.    Schedule a SetParameterValues call to be made on the 
          "InternetGatewayDevice.IPPingDiagnostics." object on the DUT, changing the value of the 
          "DiagnosticsState" parameter to "Requested". 
     4.    Allow the DUT to send a SetParameterValuesResponse. 
     5.    Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     6.    Allow the DUT to perform the IP Ping Diagnostics Test. 
     7.    Allow the DUT to initiate a CWMP connection with the CWMP Analyzer to report the completion 
          of the diagnostics test. 
     8.    Schedule a GetParameterValues call to be made on the 
          "InternetGatewayDevice.IPPingDiagnostics." object on the DUT. 
     9.    Allow the CPE to send a GetParameterValuesResponse. 
     10.   Record the parameter values of the IPPingDiagnostics object. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
     1.    The DUT is able to initiate an IP Ping Diagnostics test. 
     2.    The DUT updates the results of the IP Ping Diagnostics test. 

!4 Possible Problems:
 
    1.    The CPE and ACS cannot establish a transport layer connection. 
    2.    The CPE and ACS cannot initiate a CWMP session. 
    3.    The CPE or ACS has an invalid CWMP message structure. 
    4.    The CPE cannot perform the ping test correctly.
