!4 Resource Requirements:
 
          -   CPE (DUT) 
          -   CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

!4 Test setup:
 
          1.    Test Setup 1 or 2 

!4 Discussion:
 
          One use case of the CPE WAN Management Protocol is to allow those deploying customer 
premises equipment to remotely provision parameters on the CPE in order to set up a user's home network 
and internet access.  The parameters for provisioning of the home gateway (or IGD, Internet Gateway 
Device) are specified in Broadband Forum TR-098 [2].        Due to the ubiquity of wireless LAN technology 
on customer premises equipment, this test was designed to exercise that functionality.  This test covers CPE 
that are designed to act as a wireless LAN access point (AP). 
           A wireless LAN enabled device may support authentication and/or encryption.        The parameters in 
[2] that this test exercises upon initial setup, and their associated values include:

!4 Procedure:
 
     1.    Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     2.   Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP connection with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.   Schedule a GetParameterNames RPC on the .WLANConfiguration partial path to ensure the 
         presence of the parameters in tables 2.4.1 through 2.4.3. 
     4.   Record the existing WLANConfiguration objects. 
     5.   Schedule a SetParameterValues RPC on the DUT with the parameters and values contained in 
         tables 2.4.1 through 2.4.3, depending on the parameters supported. 
     6.   Allow the DUT to send a SetParameterValuesResponse. 
     7.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     8.   Schedule a GetParameterValues RPC on the .WLANConfiguration. partial path. 
     9.   Allow the DUT to send a GetParameterValuesResponse. 
     10.   Verify that the parameters set in step 4 have been changed. 
     11.   Externally verify that a wireless LAN station can connect to the CPE's AP using the 
         authentication and/or encryption methods specified. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
     1.    The DUT is able to provision the parameters in Tables 2.4.1 through 2.4.3, where supported. 
     2.   The wireless LAN station is able to connect to the CPE's AP using the newly specified 
         configuration. 

!4 Possible Problems:
 
     1.    The DUT may not support the use of the WLANConfiguration object.       If this is the case, treat 
         these metrics as optional. 
     2.   Interoperability issues may exist with the WLAN station used.
