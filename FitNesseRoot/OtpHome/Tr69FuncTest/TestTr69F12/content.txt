!4 Resource Requirements:
 
          -    CPE (DUT) 
          -    CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

!4 Test setup:
 
          -    Test Setup 1 

!4 Discussion:
 
          CWMP allows for numerous events that trigger the CPE to initiate a session with the ACS.               One 
such event is the PeriodicInform, defined in Broadband Forum TR-106 Amendment 2 [2].                  According to 
[2], when the PeriodicInformEnable parameter is set to "True" by either local means or by the ACS, the 
CPE MUST initiate a CMWP session at every recurrence of the PeriodicInformInterval parameter, 
specified in seconds from PeriodicInformTime. 
          According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], all CWMP sessions begin with the CPE making an 
Inform RPC on the ACS.        The Inform RPC contains a list of event codes as one of its arguments that 
specifies the reason that the CPE initiated the session.     For periodic sessions, the event code list MUST 
contain the event code "2 PERIODIC". 
          This test is designed to verify that the DUT will initiate CWMP sessions when Periodic Inform is 
enabled and that the proper event code is delivered.       Further, it verifies that when the 
PeriodicInformInterval is changed, the DUT will adjust the period in which it initiates sessions. 

!4 Procedure:
 
     1.    Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     2.    Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.    Utilizing the GetParameterValues RPC, retrieve and record the value of the 
          PeriodicInformInterval parameter. 
     4.    Utilizing the SetParameterValues RPC, instruct the DUT to set the PeriodicInformInterval to 
          either 45 or 60 seconds (ensuring that it is different from its current value), and record this value. 
     5.    Utilizing the SetParameterValues RPC, instruct the DUT to set the PeriodicInformEnable 
          parameter to "true". 
     6.    Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     7.    Repeat step 2. 
     8.    Utilizing the Reboot RPC, instruct the DUT to reboot. 
     9.    Wait for the DUT to reconnect to the network and initiate a session with the CWMP 
          Generator/Analyzer. 
     10.   Repeat step 3.  Ensure that the PeriodicInformInterval and PeriodicInformEnable parameter 
          changes were retained. 
     11.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     12.   Wait for a period greater than the value set in step 4. 
     13.   Allow the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     14.   Record the time elapsed between the initiation of sessions and ensure that it is equal to the value 
          set in step 4. 
     15.   Analyze the CWMP Inform RPC made by the DUT and ensure it contains the event code "2 
          PERIODIC" 
     16.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
     1.   The DUT accepts the changes to the PeriodicInform parameters and retains them across reboot. 
     2.   The DUT initiates CWMP sessions on the periodic interval when Periodic Inform is enabled. 
     3.   The DUT includes the event code "2 PERIODIC" in the event code list in the Inform RPC. 

!4 Possible Problems:
 
     1.   The DUT cannot complete the SetParameterValues RPC.        If this is the case, record the error and 
         attempt to set the PeriodicInformInterval through local means. 
     2.   The DUT does not have a value provided for PeriodicInformTime ([2]).     Some DUT may require 
         that an absolute time reference be acquired before properly utilizing the periodic inform function.
