!4 Discussion:
 
         According to [2], parameters in any give CWMP data model contain two attributes.     These 
attributes include the "Notification" attribute and the "Subscriber" attribute. This test is focused on 
examining the functions of the Notification attribute. 
         Attributes are manipulated via the SetParameterAttributes RPC and corresponding 
SetParameterAttributesResponse ([1]).   The SetParameterAttributesResponse contains no arguments.      The 
ACS makes the SetParameterAttributes procedure call with one argument.      The argument is the 
ParameterList, which is an array of structures specific to the SetParameterAttributes RPC 
(SetParameterAttributesStruct).  This structure contains five variables, three of which apply to 
Notifications. The first is Name, which is the path name of the parameter to apply the new attributes. This 
path may be "complete", in which a specific parameter is named, or "partial", in which all of an object's 
lower level parameters are intended to be changed.  Second is NotificationChange, which is a Boolean 
value indicating that the value of the Notification variable (following) should replace the current value in 
the CPE's data model.   Third is Notification, an enumeration of three values from 0 to 2. From [1]: 
          (Notification) Indicates whether the CPE will include changed 
         values of the specified parameter(s) in the Inform message, and 
         whether the CPE will initiate a session to the ACS when the 
         specified parameter(s) change in value. The following values are 
         defined: 
         0 = Notification off. The CPE need not inform the ACS of a change 
         to the specified parameter(s). 
         1 = Passive notification. Whenever the specified parameter value 
         changes, the CPE MUST include the new value in the ParameterList 
         in the Inform message that is sent the next time a session is 
         established to the ACS.  If the CPE has rebooted, or the URL of 
         the ACS has changed since the last session, the CPE MAY choose 
         not to include the list of changed parameters in the first 
         session established with the new ACS. 
         2 = Active notification. Whenever the specified parameter value 
         changes, the CPE MUST initiate  a session to the ACS, and include 
         the new value in the ParameterList in the associated Inform 
         message. 
          Whatever notification means are assigned to the parameter, the session in which the change is later 
conveyed must contain the event code "4 VALUE CHANGE" in the event list of the Inform RPC. 
          The CPE may deny the application of Active notification to any parameter (other than those that 
are Forced Active, [2]) that it decides may be disruptive if active notification were present.    The CPE may 
not deny the application of passive notification to any parameter ([1]). 
         Unless a set of parameters can be found that the CPE does not consider disruptive and will update 
without human interaction (such as statistics or time counters), this test requires manual stimulation of the 
CPE at some point during the test, particularly for Active notification. 

!4 Procedure:
 
     1.    Analyzing the DUT's supported data model, choose a set of parameter paths (one for Active 
         notification, one for Passive notification) that will automatically update or that can be changed 
          locally on the CPE.  It is recommended to use a partial path for Passive notifications.    Record 
          these parameters. 
     2.    Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.    Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     4.    Schedule a SetParameterAttributes remote procedure call on the DUT with the parameter selected 
          for Active notification in step 1. 
     5.    Allow the DUT to send a SetParameterAttributesResponse. 
     6.    Stimulate the DUT to alter the parameter(s) selected in step 1. 
     7.    Allow the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer, and analyze the 
          Inform RPC. 
     8.    Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     9.    Repeat step 3. 
     10.   Schedule a SetParameterAttributes remote procedure call on the DUT with the parameter selected 
          for Passive notification in step 1. 
     11.   Repeat steps 5-6. 
     12.   Make a ConnectionRequest to the DUT as described in test TR69F.1.1, above. 
     13.   Allow the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer, and analyze the 
          Inform RPC. 
     14.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
     1.    The DUT successfully completes the SetParameterAttributes RPC. 
     2.    The DUT performs Active notification by immediately initiating a session with the CWMP 
          Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.    The Inform RPC made during the Active notification session contains the event code "4 VALUE 
          CHANGE".      The parameter changed and their new values are listed in the list of parameters in the 
          Inform RPC. 
     4.    The DUT performs Passive notification in its next session with the CWMP Generator Analyzer. 
          The Inform RPC during this session contains the event code "4 VALUE CHANGE".               The 
         parameter changed and their new values are listed in the list of parameters in the Inform RPC. 

!4 Possible Problems:
 
     1.    According to [1], the CPE may choose not to include the list of changed parameters if the first 
          session established for passive notification is due to a "1 BOOT" or "0 BOOTSTRAP" event. 
          This is problematic in the event that the CPE requires a reboot in order to apply the parameter 
          change, and will cause the result of this test to be inconclusive.
