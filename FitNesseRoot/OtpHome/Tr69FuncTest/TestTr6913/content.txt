Test TR69.1.3:    Session Retry 

!4 Purpose:
    This test is designed to demonstrate that the DUT can handle a broken communications session 
using the retry policy defined in section 3.2.1.1 of Broadband Forum TR-069 [1].

!4 Discussion:
 
         Broadband Forum TR-069 [1] specifies the behavior of a CWMP system in the event that CWMP 
messages are lost during a session.  This allows lost events to be delivered and gives an opportunity for the 
ACS to make additional requests that may have been missed.       In the event that a session is terminated 
unsuccessfully (from a loss of transport, etc.), the CPE retries the session after a random interval time (in 
seconds), which increases with each unsuccessful retry (see table 1.6.1).   The ACS is assumed to store 
unsuccessfully transmitted requests for delivery when the session is again established.

!4 Procedure:
 
     1.    Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     2.   Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP connection with the ACS. 
     3.   Allow the CPE to make an Inform remote procedure call. 
     4.   Terminate the TCP connection without sending an InformResponse. 
     5.   Allow the CPE to retry the session.  Configure the CWMP Generator/Analyzer to not open a 
         session when the HTTP POST is received. 
     6.   Ensure that the new session occurs within the Interval Range specified in table 1.6.1. 
     7.   Repeat steps 4-5 up to five times. 
     8.   Upon the sixth attempt, allow the session to occur. 
     9.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
     1.    The DUT successfully uses the session retry functionality defined in [1] to complete the CWMP 
         transaction.
