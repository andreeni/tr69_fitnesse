Test TR69.2.1:     Initial Provisioning Test 

!4 Purpose:
     This test is designed to verify that the DUT can successfully connect to the network, 
communicate with the ACS for the first time, and undergo some baseline initial provisioning.

!4 Resource Requirements:
 
          -    CPE (DUT) 
          -    CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

!4 Test setup:
 
          1.    Test Setup 1 or 2 

!4 Discussion:
 
          One use case of the CPE WAN Management Protocol is to allow those deploying customer 
premises equipment to remotely provision parameters on the CPE in order to set up a user's home network 
and internet access.   The parameters for provisioning of the home gateway (or IGD, Internet Gateway 
Device) are specified in Broadband Forum TR-098 [2]. 
          When a CPE first contacts the ACS, it must initiate a session containing the "0 BOOTSTRAP" 
event code.   Unless the CPE has failed to contact the ACS for this purpose and has accumulated other 
events, no other event codes can be included with the BOOTSTRAP event.              This initial Inform instructs the 
ACS that the CPE has contacted it for the first time and should undergo initial provisioning. 
          The particular objects and parameters altered during initial provisioning will vary from 
deployment to deployment.      This test suggests a set of parameters that may or may not be available on the 
CPE but are presumed to be supported by an Internet Gateway Device or are convenient for test setup 
purposes.   For example, many deployments may utilize the WANPPPConnection object, while for test 
setup purposes WANIPConnection may be more appropriate, and a static WANIPConnection can be better 
exercised than one whose address is automatically configured. 
          This test attempts the following functions: 
                    1.    Set the Connection Request username and password. 
                    2.    Set the DUT to accept management of upgrades only from the ACS. 
                    3.    Set the network time parameters of the DUT. 
                    4.    Read the current WANConnectionDevice table to see what the main 
                         WANConnectionDevice (the one that is communicating with the ACS) has been set 
                         to. 
                    5.    Create a new WANConnectionDevice, with its own LinkConfig and 
                         WANIPConnection. 
                    6.    Set the WANIPConnection's parameters. 
          Steps 5 and 6 are dependent on the type of physical interface used for the WAN port of the DUT. 
For DSL, this would include the WANDSLLinkConfig or WANPTMLinkConfig.                      Other 
WANConnectionDevice configuration objects can be used for this test as well. 
           At minimum, this test configures the following generic parameters based on Broadband Forum

!4 Procedure:
 
     1.    Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     2.    Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP connection with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.    Allow the DUT to make an Inform RPC including the "0 BOOTSTRAP" event. 
     4.    Schedule a SetParameterValues RPC on the DUT with the parameters and values contained in 
          Table 2.1.1. 
     5.    Allow the DUT to send a SetParameterValuesResponse. 
     6.    Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     7.    Schedule a GetParameterValues RPC on the .ManagementServer., .Time., and .WANDevice. 
          partial paths. 
     8.   Allow the DUT to send a GetParameterValuesResponse. 
     9.   Verify that the parameters set in step 4 have been changed. 
     10.   Record the existing WANConnectionDevice objects. 
     11.   Make a Connection Request on the DUT using the new values for username and password. 
     12.   Allow the DUT to initiate a CMWP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer and make an 
         Inform RPC with the "6 CONNECTION REQUEST" event. 
     13.   Schedule an AddObject RPC on the 
         InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice object, where {i} is the existing 
         WANDevice object instance discovered in step 10. 
     14.   All the DUT to send an AddObjectResponse and reboot if necessary. 
     15.   Schedule a SetParameterValues RPC on the DUT with the parameters and values specified in the 
         appropriate LinkConfig object in Table 2.1.2. 
     16.   Repeat step 5. 
     17.   Schedule an AddObject RPC on the 
         InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{j}.WANIPConnection. object, 
         where {i} is the existing WANDevice object instance discovered in step 10, and {j} is the 
         WANConnectionDevice object instance discovered in step 14. 
     18.   Repeat step14. 
     19.   Schedule a SetParameterValues RPC on the DUT with the parameters and values specified in the 
         appropriate LinkConfig object in Table 2.1.3. 
     20.  Repeat step 5. 
     21.  Schedule a GetParameterValues RPC on the .WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{j}. partial 
         path. 
     22.  Repeat step 8. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
     1.    The DUT is able to provision the parameters in Table x. 
     2.   The DUT accepts a Connection Request with the new username and password. 
     3.   The DUT is able to create a new WANConnectionDevice object. 
     4.   The DUT is able to provision the parameters in Table y. 
     5.   The DUT is able to create a new WANIPConnection. 
     6.   The DUT is able to provision the parameters in Table z. 

!4 Possible Problems:
 
     1.    The DUT may not support the use of the WANIPConnection object.         If this is the case, treat these 
         metrics as optional. 
     2.   The DUT may not correctly route CWMP traffic upon the creation of a new WANIPConnection.
