Test TR69F.1.4:    GetRPCMethods 

!4 Purpose:
    This test is designed to verify that the DUT can perform the GetRPCMethods operation. 

!4 References:
 
         [1]        Broadband Forum TR-069 

!4 Resource Requirements:
 
         -    CPE (DUT) 
         -    CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

!4 Test setup:
 
         -    Test Setup 1 

!4 Discussion:
 
         According to [1], the GetRPCMethods method is a required function on both ACS and CPE.          This 
method allows the ACS to learn the CWMP methods that are supported by the CPE, or for the CPE to learn 
the CWMP methods that are supported by the ACS. 
         The first link partner, with a simple remote procedure call with no arguments, initiates the 
GetRPCMethods method.       The GetRPCMethods response contains an argument called "MethodList", 
which is an array of strings containing the names of each RPC method the link partner supports.     Once this 
operation is performed, the ACS or CPE presumably stores this information for future use.     This test 
focuses on the CPE's ability to respond to a GetRPCMethods call made by the ACS. 

!4 Procedure:
 
     1.   Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     2.   Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.   Schedule a GetRPCMethods call on the DUT. 
     4.   Allow the DUT to send a GetRPCMethodsResponse. 
     5.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     6.   Record the list reported by the DUT's GetRPCMethodsResponse. 

!4 Test Metrics:
 
     1.   The DUT reports its supported Methods in the GetRPCMethodsResponse. 

!4 Possible Problems:
 
     1.   It is possible that the DUT does not report all of its supported Methods, or does not support 
         Methods that are required by [1].  This case is beyond the scope of this test.
