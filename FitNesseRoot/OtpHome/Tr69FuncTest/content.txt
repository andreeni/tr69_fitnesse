!3 Organization of Tests:
Each test contains an identification section that describes the test and provides cross-reference information.
The discussion section covers background information and specifies why the test is to be performed. Tests
are grouped in order to reduce setup time in the lab environment. Each test contains the following
information:
!4 Test number
The Test Number associated with each test follows a simple grouping structure. Listed first is the Test
Group Number followed by the test's number within the group. This allows for the addition of future
tests to the appropriate groups of the test suite without requiring the renumbering of the subsequent
tests.
!4 Purpose
The purpose is a brief statement outlining what the test attempts to achieve. This also includes
background information on why one needs to perform such a test to show that the device complies
with the standard.
!4 References
The references section lists standards and other documentation that might be helpful in understanding
and evaluating the test and results.
!4 Resource requirements
The requirements section specifies the hardware, and test equipment that will be needed to perform the
test. The items contained in this section are special test devices or other facilities, which may not be
available on all devices.
!4 Test setup
The setup section describes the configuration of the test environment. Small changes in the
configuration should be included in the test procedure.
!4 Discussion
The discussion section is optional. It is a general discussion of the test and relevant section of the
specification, including any assumptions made in the design or implementation of the test as well as
known limitations.
!4 Procedure
The procedure section of the test description contains the step-by-step instructions for carrying out the
test. It provides a cookbook approach to testing, and may be interspersed with test metrics.
!4 Test Metrics
The test metrics section lists the necessary parameters for success in a given test. When multiple values
are possible for a specific event, this section provides a short discussion on how to interpret them. The
tests are structured so that failure of one test metric will result in a failure for the entire test, or a
request to refer to comments.
!4 Possible problems
This section contains a description of known issues with the test procedure, which may affect test
results in certain situations.
