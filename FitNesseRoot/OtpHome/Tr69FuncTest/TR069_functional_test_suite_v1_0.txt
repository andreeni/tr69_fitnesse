Introduction 

Overview 
           The   University   of   New   Hampshire’s   InterOperability   Laboratory   (UNH-IOL)   is   an   institution 
designed to improve the interoperability of standards based products by providing an environment where a 
product can be tested against the criteria of that standard. This suite of tests has been developed to help 
implementers   evaluate   the   functionality   of   their   CWMP   implementations   when   tested   for   common   use 
cases. 
           The   success   metrics   of   these   tests   are   based   on  the   functional   intentions   of   the   standards 
referenced   in   this   document.       Successful   completion  of   all   tests   contained   in   this   suite   does   not 
guarantee that the tested devices will operate with other devices, nor are the tests comprehensive of 
the   complete   functionality   of   these   standards.   However,   these   tests   provide   a   reasonable   level   of 
confidence that the Device Under Test will function well in most standard deployments. 

Organization of Tests: 
Each test contains an identification section that describes the test and provides cross-reference information. 
The discussion section covers background information and specifies why the test is to be performed. Tests 
are   grouped    in  order   to  reduce   setup   time  in  the  lab   environment.   Each   test   contains   the   following 
information: 

     Test number 
     The Test Number associated with each test follows a simple grouping structure. Listed first is the Test 
     Group Number followed by the test's number within the group. This allows for the addition of future 
     tests to the appropriate groups of the test suite without requiring the renumbering of the subsequent 
     tests. 

     Purpose 
     The   purpose   is   a   brief   statement   outlining   what   the   test   attempts   to   achieve. This   also   includes 
     background information on why one needs to perform such a test to show that the device complies 
     with the standard. 

     References 
     The references section lists standards and other documentation that might be helpful in understanding 
     and evaluating the test and results. 

     Resource requirements 
     The requirements section specifies the hardware, and test equipment that will be needed to perform the 
     test. The items contained in this section are special test devices or other facilities, which may not be 
     available on all devices. 

     Test setup 
     The     setup   section   describes    the  configuration     of  the   test  environment.     Small    changes    in  the 
     configuration should be included in the test procedure. 

     Discussion 
     The   discussion   section   is   optional.  It is a general discussion of the test and relevant section of the 
     specification, including any assumptions made in the design or implementation of the test as well as 
     known limitations. 

     Procedure 
     The procedure section of the test description contains the step-by-step instructions for carrying out the 
     test. It provides a cookbook approach to testing, and may be interspersed with test metrics. 

----------------------- Page 6-----------------------

Test Metrics 
The test metrics section lists the necessary parameters for success in a given test. When multiple values 
are possible for a specific event, this section provides a short discussion on how to interpret them. The 
tests   are   structured   so   that   failure   of   one   test   metric   will   result   in   a   failure   for   the   entire   test,   or   a 
request to refer to comments. 

Possible problems 
This   section   contains   a   description   of   known   issues   with   the   test   procedure,   which   may   affect   test 
results in certain situations.

  Auto-Configuration               The   ACS   is   a   server   that  stores CPE information, responds to CPE requests, 
  Server                           and schedules CWMP RPCs to be made on the CPE. 
  Customer Premises                A CPE is any device that sits logically or physically on the subscriber end of 
  Equipment                        the network.     It can refer to gateways as well as LAN side devices such as set- 
                                   top-boxes. 
  Data Model                        The   structure   of   objects   and   their   associated   parameters   that   correspond   to 
                                   configuration   details   and   values   on   the   CPE.   In   CWMP,   these   are   usually 
                                   organized   into   profiles   based   on   the   CPE’s   function,   and   are   detailed   in   an

                                   requirements for a particular function that the CPE may support.                 In CWMP, 
                                   these    are  usually   detailed   in  an   individual    Broadband     Forum     data  model 
                                   Technical Report. 
  Remote Procedure Call             An   RPC    is  a  function   or  method     that  is  invoked   from   a  peer   process   or 
                                   program.     In CWMP, they are used by the CPE and ACS to invoke functions 
                                   on each other. 
  Schema                            The list of data types, attributes, and syntax for a given XML implementation. 
                                   An    individual   XML   document   can   be   checked,   using   a   schema   validation 
                                   utility, to see if it complies with the definitions in the schema. 
  Session                           A   complete   CWMP   transaction,   beginning   with   the   CPE’s   initiation   of   the 
                                   session,    the   performance     of   the  Inform    RPC,    any   further   RPCs    or  fault 
                                   messages, and the termination of the session.

Group 1 – Basic Protocol Functionality 

          The tests in Group One are designed to validate that the DUT can perform the basic functionality 
required for CWMP operation.     This includes the initiation and maintenance of sessions, the performance 
of notifications, and error generation. 
         In all tests, it is assumed that an underlying level of compliance (e.g., XML that is valid according 
to the schemas provided in [1], [2], and [3]) exists for communication to occur.    The success metrics of 
these tests DO NOT include these assumptions, and do not provide for normative protocol compliance – 
they are meant to exercise the DUT’s ability to accomplish basic CWMP tasks.  Any issues that arise due to 
obvious non-compliance will be recorded as part of the test reporting process.

 Test TR69F.1.1:    TCP Connection Request 

Purpose:    This test is designed to demonstrate that the DUT can receive a Connection Request over a TCP 
connection and that it initiates a session based on it. 

References: 
          [1]       Broadband Forum TR-069 

Resource Requirements: 
          •   CPE (DUT) 
          •   CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

Test setup: 
          •   Test Setup 1 

Discussion: 
          According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], the ACS may stimulate the CPE to initiate a CWMP 
session by sending a Connection Request message.       This message is an HTTP 1.1 GET to a URL that is 
specified by the CPE.   As such, it is dependent upon prior communication with the CPE. 
          The CPE responds to the HTTP GET with either an HTTP “200 (OK)” or “204 (No Content)” 
status message of zero length.   If the ability to service the Connection Request is not available (due to 
resource constraints or denial of service protection), the CPE responds with an error “503 (Service 
Unavailable)” message.    Within 30 seconds of completion of this transaction, the CPE then initiates a 
CWMP session with the ACS.        If the session is not initiated within 30 seconds, the ACS may attempt to 
retry the Connection Request. 
          According to [1], all CWMP sessions begin with the CPE making an Inform RPC on the ACS. 
The Inform RPC contains a list of event codes as one of its arguments that specifies the reason that the CPE 
initiated the session. For connection request sessions, the event code list MUST contain the event code “6 
CONNECTION REQUEST”. 
          TR-069 demands that the CPE must authenticate the ACS before initiating the session (using 
digest authentication) to prevent denial of service attacks, using pre-set usernames and passwords.  This test 
acts as verification that the DUT can successfully authenticate and receive the Connection Request, and 
that a subsequent CWMP session is initiated. 

Procedure: 
     1.    Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator. 
     2.    Configure a predetermined username and password to be used for authentication on the CPE. 
     3.    Send a Connection Request to the CPE. 
     4.    Allow the CPE to authenticate the Connection Request and initiate a CWMP Session. 
     5.    Allow the session to terminate successfully. 

Test Metrics: 
     1.    The DUT successfully utilizes Connection Request to stimulate the CPE. 
     2.    The CPE initiates a CWMP session. 

Possible Problems: 
     1.    The CPE firewall is not configured to allow the Connection Request to be received. 
     2.    The CPE does not follow the steps necessary to initiate a CWMP connection, such as making a 
          CMWP Inform RPC on the ACS.

Test TR69F.1.2:      Periodic Inform 

Purpose:     This test is designed to demonstrate that the DUT makes use of the CWMP Periodic Inform. 

References:

Resource Requirements: 
          •    CPE (DUT) 
          •    CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

Test setup: 
          •    Test Setup 1 

Discussion: 
          CWMP allows for numerous events that trigger the CPE to initiate a session with the ACS.               One 
such event is the PeriodicInform, defined in Broadband Forum TR-106 Amendment 2 [2].                  According to 
[2], when the PeriodicInformEnable parameter is set to “True” by either local means or by the ACS, the 
CPE MUST initiate a CMWP session at every recurrence of the PeriodicInformInterval parameter, 
specified in seconds from PeriodicInformTime. 
          According to Broadband Forum TR-069 [1], all CWMP sessions begin with the CPE making an 
Inform RPC on the ACS.        The Inform RPC contains a list of event codes as one of its arguments that 
specifies the reason that the CPE initiated the session.     For periodic sessions, the event code list MUST 
contain the event code “2 PERIODIC”. 
          This test is designed to verify that the DUT will initiate CWMP sessions when Periodic Inform is 
enabled and that the proper event code is delivered.       Further, it verifies that when the 
PeriodicInformInterval is changed, the DUT will adjust the period in which it initiates sessions. 

Procedure: 
     1.    Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     2.    Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.    Utilizing the GetParameterValues RPC, retrieve and record the value of the 
          PeriodicInformInterval parameter. 
     4.    Utilizing the SetParameterValues RPC, instruct the DUT to set the PeriodicInformInterval to 
          either 45 or 60 seconds (ensuring that it is different from its current value), and record this value. 
     5.    Utilizing the SetParameterValues RPC, instruct the DUT to set the PeriodicInformEnable 
          parameter to “true”. 
     6.    Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     7.    Repeat step 2. 
     8.    Utilizing the Reboot RPC, instruct the DUT to reboot. 
     9.    Wait for the DUT to reconnect to the network and initiate a session with the CWMP 
          Generator/Analyzer. 
     10.   Repeat step 3.  Ensure that the PeriodicInformInterval and PeriodicInformEnable parameter 
          changes were retained. 
     11.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     12.   Wait for a period greater than the value set in step 4. 
     13.   Allow the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     14.   Record the time elapsed between the initiation of sessions and ensure that it is equal to the value 
          set in step 4. 
     15.   Analyze the CWMP Inform RPC made by the DUT and ensure it contains the event code “2 
          PERIODIC” 
     16.   Allow the session to terminate successfully.

     1.   The DUT accepts the changes to the PeriodicInform parameters and retains them across reboot. 
     2.   The DUT initiates CWMP sessions on the periodic interval when Periodic Inform is enabled. 
     3.   The DUT includes the event code “2 PERIODIC” in the event code list in the Inform RPC. 

Possible Problems: 
     1.   The DUT cannot complete the SetParameterValues RPC.        If this is the case, record the error and 
         attempt to set the PeriodicInformInterval through local means. 
     2.   The DUT does not have a value provided for PeriodicInformTime ([2]).     Some DUT may require 
         that an absolute time reference be acquired before properly utilizing the periodic inform function.

Test TR69.1.3:    Session Retry

using the retry policy defined in section 3.2.1.1 of Broadband Forum TR-069 [1].

Discussion: 
         Broadband Forum TR-069 [1] specifies the behavior of a CWMP system in the event that CWMP 
messages are lost during a session.  This allows lost events to be delivered and gives an opportunity for the 
ACS to make additional requests that may have been missed.       In the event that a session is terminated 
unsuccessfully (from a loss of transport, etc.), the CPE retries the session after a random interval time (in 
seconds), which increases with each unsuccessful retry (see table 1.6.1).   The ACS is assumed to store 
unsuccessfully transmitted requests for delivery when the session is again established.

Test TR69F.1.4:    GetRPCMethods 

Purpose:    This test is designed to verify that the DUT can perform the GetRPCMethods operation. 

References:

Resource Requirements: 
         •    CPE (DUT) 
         •    CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

Test setup: 
         •    Test Setup 1 

Discussion: 
         According to [1], the GetRPCMethods method is a required function on both ACS and CPE.          This 
method allows the ACS to learn the CWMP methods that are supported by the CPE, or for the CPE to learn 
the CWMP methods that are supported by the ACS. 
         The first link partner, with a simple remote procedure call with no arguments, initiates the 
GetRPCMethods method.       The GetRPCMethods response contains an argument called “MethodList”, 
which is an array of strings containing the names of each RPC method the link partner supports.     Once this 
operation is performed, the ACS or CPE presumably stores this information for future use.     This test 
focuses on the CPE’s ability to respond to a GetRPCMethods call made by the ACS. 

Procedure: 
     1.   Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     2.   Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.   Schedule a GetRPCMethods call on the DUT. 
     4.   Allow the DUT to send a GetRPCMethodsResponse. 
     5.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     6.   Record the list reported by the DUT’s GetRPCMethodsResponse. 

Test Metrics: 
     1.   The DUT reports its supported Methods in the GetRPCMethodsResponse. 

Possible Problems: 
     1.   It is possible that the DUT does not report all of its supported Methods, or does not support 
         Methods that are required by [1].  This case is beyond the scope of this test.

Resource Requirements:

         •    CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

Test setup: 
         •    Test Setup 1 

Discussion: 
         According to [1], the GetParameterNames method is a required function on the CPE.        The ACS 
may use this method to learn the particular parameters (and their read/write attributes) that it can access on 
the CPE. 
         The ACS makes this procedure call with two arguments.       The first is the ParameterPath, which 
indicates the path in the object hierarchy under which the ACS wishes to learn the names of supported 
parameters.  This path may be “complete”, in which the specific parameter is named to determine if it is 
available, or “partial”, in which all of an objects lower level parameters are returned (as determined by the 
value of NextLevel, below). 
         The second parameter is NextLevel, which is a Boolean value that determines whether or not to 
return all objects and parameters beneath the specified partial path (NextLevel = False), or to only return 
those that are “Next Level” children of the partial path (NextLevel = True).   Once this operation is 
performed, the ACS presumably stores this information for future use. 
         When the ACS sends a GetParameterNames procedure call containing a ParameterPath argument 
that points to the root device object (for example, InternetGatewayDevice. or Device. depending on the 
device type and data model used) and when NextLevel is set to false, the CPE responds with its entire 
object model.  A CPE may not respond with a resources exceeded fault (Fault 9004) in this circumstance. 
         The GetParameterNamesResponse from the CPE contains one argument.            This is ParameterList, 
which is an array of ParameterInfoStruct structures, each containing the name of the parameter (Name) and 
a Boolean value (Writable) which indicates the read/write capability of the parameter. 
         This test is designed to verify that the DUT can perform this operation without error, and that it 
uses correct error handling when a parameter does not exist.   An additional step is added to validate the 
XML sent by the DUT to ensure that an ACS that correctly interprets CWMP messages will understand the 
message sent by the DUT. 

Procedure: 
     1.    Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     2.   Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.   Schedule a GetParameterNames call on the DUT with the following arguments: 
                   ParameterPath = InternetGatewayDevice. or Device. 
                  NextLevel = false 
     4.   Allow the DUT to send a GetParameterNamesResponse. 
     5.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     6.   Validate the GetParameterNamesResponse. 
     7.   Repeat steps 2 and 3 with the following arguments:

Test TR69F.1.6:    GetParameterValues 

Purpose:    This test is designed to verify that the DUT can perform a GetParameterValues function when 
the entire device object model is requested.

Resource Requirements: 
         •    CPE (DUT) 
         •    CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

Test setup: 
         •    Test Setup 1 

Discussion: 
         According to [1], the GetParameterValues method is a required function on the CPE.       The ACS 
may use this method to learn the particular parameters and their current values that exist on the CPE. 
         The ACS makes this procedure call with two arguments.       The first is the ParameterPath, which 
indicates the path in the object hierarchy under which the ACS wishes to learn the names of supported 
parameters.  This path may be “complete”, in which the specific parameter is named to determine if it is 
available, or “partial”, in which all of an objects lower level parameters are returned. 
         When the ACS sends a GetParameteValues procedure call containing a ParameterPath argument 
that points to the root device object (for example, InternetGatewayDevice. or Device. depending on the 
device type and data model used), the CPE responds with its entire object model.     A CPE MAY instead 
respond with a resources exceeded fault (Fault 9004) in this circumstance. 
         The GetParameterValuesResponse from the CPE contains one argument.           This is ParameterList, 
which is an array of ParameterValueStruct structures, each containing the name of the parameter (Name), 
and its current value (Value). 
         This test is designed to verify that the DUT can perform this operation without error.   An 
additional step is added to validate the XML sent by the DUT to ensure that an ACS that correctly 
interprets CWMP messages will understand the message sent by the DUT. 

Procedure: 
     1.    Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     2.   Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.   Schedule a GetParameterValues call on the DUT with the following arguments: 
              a.    ParameterPath = InternetGatewayDevice. or Device. 
     4.   Allow the DUT to send a GetParameterNamesResponse or return a Resources Exceeded fault 
         (Fault 9004). 
     5.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     6.   Validate the GetParameterNamesResponse. 

Test Metrics: 
     1.    The DUT returns the parameter names and values of all parameters in its data hierarchy through 
         the GetParameterValuesResponse. 
     2.   The GetParameterNamesResponse XML is valid. 
     3.   All sessions are terminated successfully. 

Possible Problems:

Test TR69.1.7:    Reboot 

Purpose:    This test is designed to verify that the CPE can perform the Reboot function. 

References: 
          [1]       Broadband Forum TR-069 

Resource Requirements: 
          •  CPE (DUT) 
          •  CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

Test setup: 
          1.  Test Setup 1 or 2 

Discussion: 
          According to [1], the ACS may trigger a reboot in the CPE through use of the Reboot remote 
procedure call, primarily for troubleshooting purposes.     It is intended that the CPE sends the message 
response and completes the current CWMP session before doing so. 
          At the conclusion of the reboot, the CPE issues the standard Inform RPC on the ACS with the “1 
BOOT” and “M Reboot” event codes. 

Procedure: 
     1.    Establish a network layer connection between the DUT and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     2.    Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.    Schedule a Reboot RPC on the DUT. 
     4.    Allow the DUT to respond to the Reboot remote procedure call. 
     5.    Allow the CWMP session to terminate successfully. 
     6.    Wait for the DUT to reboot. 
     7.    Allow the DUT to communicate its boot inform to the ACS. 
     8.    Allow the new session to terminate successfully. 
     9.    If any of the test metrics below fail, record and report the entire transaction. 

Test Metrics: 
     1.    The DUT successfully initiates a CWMP session. 
     2.    The RebootResponse is received. 
     3.    The DUT Reboots. 
     4.    The DUT successfully completes an Inform RPC upon reboot containing the event codes “1 
          BOOT” and “M Reboot”. 

Possible Problems: 
     1.    The DUT may take an abnormal amount of time to reboot.         If this is the case, the DUT should be 
          observed physically if possible to ensure this is the case and the test retried. 
     2.    The DUT may have other events that had remained undelivered at the time of the Reboot.          While 
          this test does not check to ensure that the events were delivered, these events should be recorded 
          and it should be ensured that the events do not interfere with the “1 BOOT” and “M Reboot” 
          events.

Test TR69F.1.8:     SetParameterValues

Resource Requirements: 
          •   CPE (DUT) 
          •   CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

Test setup: 
          •   Test Setup 1 

Discussion: 
          According to [1], the SetParameterValues method is a required function on the CPE. The ACS 
may use this method to modify the value of one or more CPE parameters. 
          The ACS makes this procedure call with two arguments.        The first is the ParameterList, which is 
an array of name-value pairs specifying which parameters to change and what to change them to. If this 
array contains more than one entry with the same parameter name, the CPE must respond with fault 9003 
(Invalid Arguments). The second is the ParameterKey value which the CPE must set if and only if 
SetParameterValues completes successfully and no fault response is generated. This parameter provides the 
ACS a means to track changes it has made, the value is left to the discretion of the ACS and may be left 
empty. 
          The SetParameterValuesResponse must be returned by the CPE after any successful 
SetParameterValues call. It contains a status argument which is set to either “0” or “1.” A “0” indicates that 
all parameter changes have been validated and applied. A “1” indicates that all parameter changes have 
been validated and committed, but some or all are not yet applied. The changes are required to be applied 
by the next session. 
          This test verifies the ability of the DUT to use the SetParameterValues RPC and to respond 
correctly when presented with bad arguments.      These bad arguments include invalid parameters, invalid 
values, invalid data types, and parameters that are not meant to be writable.    Each of these has a different 
SOAP fault code associated with them. 

Procedure: 
     1.    Analyzing the DUT’s supported data model, choose two non-service affecting writable parameters 
          to be changed on the DUT.     Record these parameters, their values, and the change values chosen. 
     2.    Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.    Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     4.    Schedule a SetParameterValues call on the DUT with the parameters selected in step 1. 
     5.    Allow the DUT to send a SetParameterValuesResponse. 
     6.    Validate the SetParameterValuesResponse. 
     7.    Schedule a GetParameterValues call on the parameters that were selected in step 1. 
     8.    Verify that the retrieved values match what was set in the SetParameterValues call. 
     9.    Repeat step 3. 
     10.   Schedule a Reboot call on the DUT. 
     11.   Repeat steps 6-7. 
     12.   Repeat steps 3-4. Instead of the value selected above choose a value that is of the wrong data type 
          or other invalid value for the parameter. 
     13.   Allow the DUT to send a Fault code of either 9006 (Invalid Parameter Type) or 9007 (Invalid 
          Parameter Value).

     14.   Validate the Fault code. 
     15.  Repeat steps 3-4. Instead of the parameters selected above choose a parameter that does not exist 
         in the DUT’s data model. 
     16.  Allow the DUT to send a Fault code of either 9005 (Invalid Parameter Name). 
     17.  Repeat step 14. 
     18.  Repeat steps 3-4. Instead of the parameters selected above choose a parameter that is meant to be 
         read-only according to [2] or any other CWMP data model that the DUT supports. 
     19.  Allow the DUT to send a Fault code of either 9008 (Attempt to Set Non-writeable Parameter). 
     20.  Repeat step 14. 
     21.  Allow the session to terminate successfully. 

Test Metrics: 
     1.   The DUT responds with a 0 or 1 status in SetParameterValuesResponse 
     2.   The SetParameterValuesResponse is valid. 
     3.   Subsequent GetParameterValues calls using the test parameters return the correct values 
     4.   The device retains the parameter changes across reboot. 
     5.   The DUT responds to the invalid values with the correct, valid fault code. 
     6.   The DUT responds to the invalid parameters with the correct, valid fault codes. 

Possible Problems: 
     1.   In some cases, parameters that are defined as write capable in the appropriate data models may be 
         rejected by the DUT.   This case is beyond the scope of this test. If the DUT returns an error, 
         “Attempt to Set Non-Writable Parameter”, new parameters should be attempted for step 1.

Resource Requirements: 
         •    CPE (DUT) 
         •    CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

Test setup: 
         •    Test Setup 1 

Discussion: 
         According to [1], the AddObject and DeleteObject methods are required functions on the CPE. 
The ACS may use these methods for a variety of purposes depending on the functionality described in the 
corresponding CPE data model, most often the creation of new instances of interface or service objects. 
         The ACS makes the AddObject procedure call with two arguments.         The first is the ObjectName, 
which is a string containing the path name of the object to be created.  According to [1], the path name 
MUST end with a “.” after the last node in the hierarchical name.    The second is the ParameterKey value 
which the CPE must set if and only if AddObject completes successfully and no fault response is generated. 
This parameter provides the ACS a means to track changes it has made, the value is left to the discretion of 
the ACS and may be left empty. 
         The AddObjectResponse must be returned by the CPE after any successful AddObject call. It 
contains two arguments.   The first is InstanceNumber, which contains the numerical reference that the ACS 
will use to address the object. This instance number must be unique to the object created, and can never be 
reused or changed.   The second is a status argument which is set to either “0” or “1.” A “0” indicates that 
all parameter changes have been validated and applied. A “1” indicates that all parameter changes have 
been validated and committed, but some or all are not yet applied. The changes are required to be applied 
by the next session. 
         The ACS makes the DeleteObject call with two arguments.        The first is the ObjectName, which is 
a string containing the full path name (including the instance number) of the object to be deleted. 
According to [1], the path name MUST end with a “.” after the instance number.      The second is the 
ParameterKey value which the CPE must set if and only if AddObject completes successfully and no fault 
response is generated. This parameter provides the ACS a means to track changes it has made, the value is 
left to the discretion of the ACS and may be left empty. 
         The DeleteObjectResponse contains a status argument which is set to either “0” or “1.” A “0” 
indicates that all parameter changes have been validated and applied. A “1” indicates that all parameter 
changes have been validated and committed, but some or all are not yet applied. The changes are required 
to be applied by the next session. 

Procedure: 
     1.    Analyzing the DUT’s supported data model, choose a     non-service affecting writable object to be 
         created on the DUT.    Record the selected object. 
     2.   Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.   Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     4.   Schedule an AddObject call on the DUT with the object selected in step 1. 
     5.   Allow the DUT to send an AddObjectResponse.       Record the instance number created by the DUT.

     7.   Schedule a GetParameterValues partial path call on the object path that was selected in step 1. 
     8.    Verify that the <object>NumberOfEntries parameter has been incremented. 
     9.   Verify that the created objects are listed with appropriately contained parameters. 
     10.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     11.   Repeat step 3. 
     12.   Schedule a DeleteObject call on the DUT with the first object created in step 5. 
     13.   Allow the DUT to send a DeleteObjectResponse. 
     14.   Repeat step 7. 
     15.   Verify that the <object>NumberOfEntries parameter has been decremented. 
     16.   Verify that the existing objects have not changed instance numbers. 
     17.   Repeat step 3. 
     18.   Schedule a Reboot call on the DUT.

Test Metrics: 
     1.    The DUT responds with a 0 or 1 status in the AddObject and DeleteObject Reponses. 
     2.   The created objects are present when created and absent when deleted. 
     3.   <object>NumberOfEntries parameter is set to the correct value. 
     4.   The instance numbers of the created objects are retained after deletion.

Purpose:    This test is designed to verify that the DUT can perform the functions and behavior necessary 
for the operation of CWMP parameter notification.

Resource Requirements: 
         •    CPE (DUT) 
         •    CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

Test setup: 
         •    Test Setup 1 

Discussion: 
         According to [2], parameters in any give CWMP data model contain two attributes.     These 
attributes include the “Notification” attribute and the “Subscriber” attribute. This test is focused on 
examining the functions of the Notification attribute. 
         Attributes are manipulated via the SetParameterAttributes RPC and corresponding 
SetParameterAttributesResponse ([1]).   The SetParameterAttributesResponse contains no arguments.      The 
ACS makes the SetParameterAttributes procedure call with one argument.      The argument is the 
ParameterList, which is an array of structures specific to the SetParameterAttributes RPC 
(SetParameterAttributesStruct).  This structure contains five variables, three of which apply to 
Notifications. The first is Name, which is the path name of the parameter to apply the new attributes. This 
path may be “complete”, in which a specific parameter is named, or “partial”, in which all of an object’s 
lower level parameters are intended to be changed.  Second is NotificationChange, which is a Boolean 
value indicating that the value of the Notification variable (following) should replace the current value in 
the CPE’s data model.   Third is Notification, an enumeration of three values from 0 to 2. From [1]: 

          (Notification) Indicates whether the CPE will include changed 
         values of the specified parameter(s) in the Inform message, and 
         whether the CPE will initiate a session to the ACS when the 
         specified parameter(s) change in value. The following values are 
         defined: 

         0 = Notification off. The CPE need not inform the ACS of a change 
         to the specified parameter(s). 

         1 = Passive notification. Whenever the specified parameter value 
         changes, the CPE MUST include the new value in the ParameterList 
         in the Inform message that is sent the next time a session is 
         established to the ACS.  If the CPE has rebooted, or the URL of 
         the ACS has changed since the last session, the CPE MAY choose 
         not to include the list of changed parameters in the first 
         session established with the new ACS. 

         2 = Active notification. Whenever the specified parameter value 
         changes, the CPE MUST initiate  a session to the ACS, and include 
         the new value in the ParameterList in the associated Inform 
         message.

          Whatever notification means are assigned to the parameter, the session in which the change is later 
conveyed must contain the event code “4 VALUE CHANGE” in the event list of the Inform RPC. 
          The CPE may deny the application of Active notification to any parameter (other than those that 
are Forced Active, [2]) that it decides may be disruptive if active notification were present.    The CPE may 
not deny the application of passive notification to any parameter ([1]). 
         Unless a set of parameters can be found that the CPE does not consider disruptive and will update 
without human interaction (such as statistics or time counters), this test requires manual stimulation of the 
CPE at some point during the test, particularly for Active notification. 

Procedure: 
     1.    Analyzing the DUT’s supported data model, choose a set of parameter paths (one for Active 
         notification, one for Passive notification) that will automatically update or that can be changed 
          locally on the CPE.  It is recommended to use a partial path for Passive notifications.    Record 
          these parameters. 
     2.    Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.    Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     4.    Schedule a SetParameterAttributes remote procedure call on the DUT with the parameter selected 
          for Active notification in step 1. 
     5.    Allow the DUT to send a SetParameterAttributesResponse. 
     6.    Stimulate the DUT to alter the parameter(s) selected in step 1. 
     7.    Allow the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer, and analyze the 
          Inform RPC. 
     8.    Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     9.    Repeat step 3. 
     10.   Schedule a SetParameterAttributes remote procedure call on the DUT with the parameter selected 
          for Passive notification in step 1. 
     11.   Repeat steps 5-6. 
     12.   Make a ConnectionRequest to the DUT as described in test TR69F.1.1, above. 
     13.   Allow the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer, and analyze the 
          Inform RPC. 
     14.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 

Test Metrics: 
     1.    The DUT successfully completes the SetParameterAttributes RPC. 
     2.    The DUT performs Active notification by immediately initiating a session with the CWMP 
          Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.    The Inform RPC made during the Active notification session contains the event code “4 VALUE 
          CHANGE”.      The parameter changed and their new values are listed in the list of parameters in the 
          Inform RPC. 
     4.    The DUT performs Passive notification in its next session with the CWMP Generator Analyzer. 
          The Inform RPC during this session contains the event code “4 VALUE CHANGE”.               The 
         parameter changed and their new values are listed in the list of parameters in the Inform RPC. 

Possible Problems: 
     1.    According to [1], the CPE may choose not to include the list of changed parameters if the first 
          session established for passive notification is due to a “1 BOOT” or “0 BOOTSTRAP” event. 
          This is problematic in the event that the CPE requires a reboot in order to apply the parameter 
          change, and will cause the result of this test to be inconclusive.

Test TR69.1.11:     Firmware Download 

Purpose:    This test is designed to verify that the DUT can perform a Download, in particular a firmware 
download, when the ACS specifies a delay before which it should occur and in the event the device is 
rebooted during this time. 

References: 
          [1]        Broadband Forum TR-069 

Resource Requirements: 
          •    CPE (DUT) 
          •    CWMP Generator/Analyzer 
          •    File Server 

Test setup: 
          1.  Test Setup 1 or 2 

Discussion: 
          According to [1], the CWMP system can use the Download RPC to upgrade firmware on the CPE. 
The firmware image can be downloaded through any common means (such as FTP or HTTP). 
          The CPE can respond to the Download RPC in one of three ways, as defined in [1]: 

     1.    It may issue a DownloadResponse with the Status argument set to 0, indicating that the download 
          was a success, or 1 if it was a failure. These test metrics are designed to test for a successful 
          firmware download. 
     2.    It may call the TransferComplete RPC on the ACS later in the same session.        The 
          DownloadResponse in this case has a Status argument of 1. 
     3.    It may call the TransferComplete RPC on the ACS later in the next session.       The 
          DownloadResponse in this case has a Status argument of 1. 

In firmware/software upgrade situations, the Download RPC is only considered successful if the new image 
is successfully installed and applied.   Since this is the most vigorous use of the Download RPC, it is 
sufficient to test the DUT’s ability to use the RPC. 

When the Download is complete, the CPE makes a TransferComplete call on the ACS.               If it is doing so in a 
new session (3, above), it indicates its intent to call TransferComplete in its Inform with the event code “7 
TRANSFER COMPLETE”.             Since in this case the TransferComplete is being called because of the use of 
the Download RPC, it also includes the “M Download” event. 

The ACS can specify the DelaySeconds argument to instruct the CPE to perform the download after a 
certain period of time.  This is usually used to perform the download a specific time specified by the user of 
the ACS.   When this delay is specified, the Download must occur after the delay has elapsed.         If the CPE 
cannot perform the download, it must do so within an hour of the delay time. 

This test is designed to test the scenario in which the device is rebooted after the Download RPC is called, 
but before DelaySeconds is reached, to ensure that the DUT still performs the download.          To accomplish 
this, additional firmware is required for the DUT, one in which no changes to the CWMP stack are 
implemented but the version number or name has changed in some way that can be indicated to the CWMP 
Analyzer.   The firmware upgrade is performed twice, once as a baseline to ensure that the upgrade can be 
performed, and secondly after a reboot is applied during the delay. 

For the purpose of this test, it is assumed that an external server is part of the test setup that allows access to 
the firmware image.    In real world scenarios, the ACS may also act as the firmware repository and hence 
make the file available through FTP or HTTP.

Procedure: 
     1.    Record the current firmware version of the DUT. 
     2.   Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.   Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     4.   Schedule a Download remote procedure call on the DUT, specifying the filename to be used and 
         the server URL, with DelaySeconds set to 0. 
     5.   Allow the DUT to send a DownloadResponse. 
     6.   Allow the DUT to perform the firmware download. 
     7.   If the DUT must reboot to apply the image (and therefore issue a TransferComplete call), wait for 
         the following: 
              a.    The DUT to Reboot 
              b.    The DUT to initiate a CWMP connection with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
              c.    The DUT to make an Inform remote procedure call, with the “7 Transfer Complete” and 
                   “M Download” event codes. 
              d.    The DUT to initiate the TransferComplete RPC. 
     8.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     9.   Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP session with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     10.   Analyze the DUT’s Inform message to ensure that it reports the new firmware version. 
     11.   Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     12.   Repeat steps 3-5 with DelaySeconds set to a large value, default 300 seconds. 
     13.   Schedule a Reboot RPC on the DUT or physically restart the device. 
     14.   Allow the DUT to perform the firmware download when the value selected in step 11 has expired. 
     15.   Repeat steps 7-11. 

Test Metrics: 
     1.    The DUT successfully performs the initial firmware upgrade. 
     2.   The DUTs Inform messages contain the correct event codes. 
     3.   The DUT successfully performs the firmware upgrade across reboot. 

Possible Problems: 
     1.    It may not be possible to obtain firmware upgrade files that change the version number on the 
         DUT while maintaining the actual CWMP stack version. 
     2.   The firmware upgrade may cause the device to become unstable.  This will cause the results of this 
         test to be inconclusive.

Group 2 – CWMP Use Case Functionality 

         The tests in Group Two are designed to test specific use cases of CWMP.        These use cases are 
device specific; that is, the use cases will apply to a particular device type with a data model that is 
specified in one or more documents that accompany TR-069 [1].        In this version of the test suite, most of 
the tests are geared towards InternetGatewayDevices (devices that implement Broadband Forum TR-098 
[3]). These tests are conditional on the support of particular profiles from these published data models.     If 
the device does not support these profiles, these tests can be considered optional. 
         These tests assume that the underlying functionality in Group One has been exercised enough in 
order to accomplish the tests in Group Two.     Problems may occur at the protocol level, and those errors 
will be recorded in the failures of these tests. It is assumed that an underlying level of compliance (e.g., 
XML that is valid according to the schemas provided in [1], [2], and [3]) exists for communication to 
occur.  The success metrics of these tests DO NOT include these assumptions, and do not provide for 
normative protocol compliance – they are meant to exercise the DUT’s ability to accomplish basic CWMP 
tasks. Any issues that arise due to obvious non-compliance will be recorded as part of the test reporting 
process.

Test TR69.2.1:     Initial Provisioning Test 

Purpose:     This test is designed to verify that the DUT can successfully connect to the network, 
communicate with the ACS for the first time, and undergo some baseline initial provisioning. 

References: 
          [1]        Broadband Forum TR-069 Amendment 2

Resource Requirements: 
          •    CPE (DUT) 
          •    CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

Test setup: 
          1.    Test Setup 1 or 2 

Discussion: 
          One use case of the CPE WAN Management Protocol is to allow those deploying customer 
premises equipment to remotely provision parameters on the CPE in order to set up a user’s home network 
and internet access.   The parameters for provisioning of the home gateway (or IGD, Internet Gateway 
Device) are specified in Broadband Forum TR-098 [2]. 
          When a CPE first contacts the ACS, it must initiate a session containing the “0 BOOTSTRAP” 
event code.   Unless the CPE has failed to contact the ACS for this purpose and has accumulated other 
events, no other event codes can be included with the BOOTSTRAP event.              This initial Inform instructs the 
ACS that the CPE has contacted it for the first time and should undergo initial provisioning. 
          The particular objects and parameters altered during initial provisioning will vary from 
deployment to deployment.      This test suggests a set of parameters that may or may not be available on the 
CPE but are presumed to be supported by an Internet Gateway Device or are convenient for test setup 
purposes.   For example, many deployments may utilize the WANPPPConnection object, while for test 
setup purposes WANIPConnection may be more appropriate, and a static WANIPConnection can be better 
exercised than one whose address is automatically configured. 
          This test attempts the following functions: 

                    1.    Set the Connection Request username and password. 
                    2.    Set the DUT to accept management of upgrades only from the ACS. 
                    3.    Set the network time parameters of the DUT. 
                    4.    Read the current WANConnectionDevice table to see what the main 
                         WANConnectionDevice (the one that is communicating with the ACS) has been set 
                         to. 
                    5.    Create a new WANConnectionDevice, with its own LinkConfig and 
                         WANIPConnection. 
                    6.    Set the WANIPConnection’s parameters. 

          Steps 5 and 6 are dependent on the type of physical interface used for the WAN port of the DUT. 
For DSL, this would include the WANDSLLinkConfig or WANPTMLinkConfig.                      Other 
WANConnectionDevice configuration objects can be used for this test as well. 
           At minimum, this test configures the following generic parameters based on Broadband Forum

Resource Requirements: 
          •   CPE (DUT) 
          •   CWMP Generator/Analyzer 

Test setup: 
          1.    Test Setup 1 or 2 

Discussion: 
          Broadband Forum TR-098 [3] defines an object and set of parameters for performing a simple 
diagnostics test utilizing the ICMP [4] based “ping” application.     The test is initiated by the ACS using a 
SetParameterValues remote procedure call that changes the value of the DiagnosticsState parameter in the 
IPPingDiagnostics object to a value of “Requested”.      The CPE then performs the diagnostic test; generally 
after the CWMP session terminates successfully. 
          This test uses the following values for the write-enabled parameters in the IPPingDiagnostics 
object: 
          1.    Host: set to the IP address of the CWMP Analyzer 
          2.   NumberofRepetitions: 10 
          3.   Timeout: 1000 
          4.   DataBlockSize: 64 
          5.   DSCP: 0 

          Upon conclusion of the test, the CPE initiates a CWMP session with an event code of “8 
DIAGNOSTICS COMPLETE” in the Inform arguments. 

Procedure: 
     1.    Establish a network layer connection between the CPE and the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     2.    Stimulate the DUT to initiate a CWMP connection with the CWMP Generator/Analyzer. 
     3.    Schedule a SetParameterValues call to be made on the 
          “InternetGatewayDevice.IPPingDiagnostics.” object on the DUT, changing the value of the 
          “DiagnosticsState” parameter to “Requested”. 
     4.    Allow the DUT to send a SetParameterValuesResponse. 
     5.    Allow the session to terminate successfully. 
     6.    Allow the DUT to perform the IP Ping Diagnostics Test. 
     7.    Allow the DUT to initiate a CWMP connection with the CWMP Analyzer to report the completion 
          of the diagnostics test. 
     8.    Schedule a GetParameterValues call to be made on the 
          “InternetGatewayDevice.IPPingDiagnostics.” object on the DUT. 
     9.    Allow the CPE to send a GetParameterValuesResponse. 
     10.   Record the parameter values of the IPPingDiagnostics object. 

Test Metrics: 
     1.    The DUT is able to initiate an IP Ping Diagnostics test. 
     2.    The DUT updates the results of the IP Ping Diagnostics test.

Discussion: 
          One use case of the CPE WAN Management Protocol is to allow those deploying customer 
premises equipment to remotely provision parameters on the CPE in order to set up a user’s home network 
and internet access.  The parameters for provisioning of the home gateway (or IGD, Internet Gateway 
Device) are specified in Broadband Forum TR-098 [2].        Due to the ubiquity of wireless LAN technology 
on customer premises equipment, this test was designed to exercise that functionality.  This test covers CPE 
that are designed to act as a wireless LAN access point (AP). 
           A wireless LAN enabled device may support authentication and/or encryption.        The parameters in
